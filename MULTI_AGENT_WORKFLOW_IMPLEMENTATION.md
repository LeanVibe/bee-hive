# Multi-Agent Workflow Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Enable real multi-agent workflows with custom commands, dashboard integration, and RealWorld Conduit demonstration to prove the 42x development velocity target.

**Current Status**: Phase 1 complete ✅, Sleep-wake integration designed ✅, Need multi-agent coordination implementation ⏳

## Multi-Agent Workflow Requirements

Based on PRD analysis and current capabilities, we need:

### 1. Real-Time Multi-Agent Coordination
```python
# Custom commands for multi-agent workflows
/team:assemble backend frontend devops testing
/workflow:start "Implement user authentication system"
/agents:sync --knowledge-domain="authentication" 
/quality:gate --multi-agent-validation
/deployment:coordinate --cross-agent-dependencies
```

### 2. Coordinated Development Workflows
```yaml
realworld_conduit_workflow:
  phase_1_foundation:
    duration: "36 minutes"
    agents: ["backend_specialist", "api_designer"]
    deliverables: ["API specification", "Database schema", "Authentication foundation"]
    
  phase_2_implementation: 
    duration: "144 minutes"
    agents: ["backend_specialist", "frontend_specialist", "testing_specialist"]
    deliverables: ["Complete API", "Frontend implementation", "Test suite"]
    
  phase_3_integration:
    duration: "48 minutes" 
    agents: ["devops_specialist", "performance_specialist", "security_specialist"]
    deliverables: ["Deployment pipeline", "Performance optimization", "Security audit"]
```

### 3. Dashboard Integration Requirements
- Real-time agent status and coordination view
- Multi-agent workflow progress tracking
- Quality gates visualization across agents
- Extended thinking session monitoring
- Hook execution status and performance metrics

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase A: Multi-Agent Command System (This Session)
1. **Enhanced Multi-Agent Commands**
   - Team assembly and coordination commands
   - Cross-agent knowledge synchronization
   - Multi-agent quality gates
   - Coordinated deployment workflows

2. **Dashboard Integration Hooks**
   - Real-time agent status streaming
   - Workflow progress visualization
   - Quality metrics dashboard integration
   - Performance monitoring enhancements

### Phase B: RealWorld Conduit Demo (Next Session)  
1. **Complete Implementation Demo**
   - 4-hour complete implementation target
   - Multi-agent coordination demonstration
   - Quality automation validation
   - Performance metrics collection

## Multi-Agent Custom Commands Implementation

Let me implement the enhanced command system that enables real multi-agent workflows:
