# Phase 2: Sleep-Wake Cycle Integration with Claude Code Features

## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Seamlessly integrate Phase 1 Claude Code features (hooks, slash commands, extended thinking) with LeanVibe's existing sleep-wake cycle system to create the ultimate autonomous agent lifecycle with context preservation, intelligent wake triggers, and quality-aware sleep management.

**Key Insight**: LeanVibe already has enterprise-grade sleep-wake infrastructure (70% context compression, checkpoints, consolidation engine). Our Phase 2 focus is enhancing this existing system with Claude Code intelligence rather than rebuilding it.

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ What LeanVibe Already Has
- **Sleep-Wake Manager**: Autonomous consolidation and recovery orchestration
- **Context Engine**: 70% token compression with semantic search and cross-agent sharing
- **Checkpoint System**: State preservation and recovery mechanisms
- **Consolidation Engine**: Intelligent context merging and optimization
- **Sleep Scheduler**: Automated sleep cycle management
- **Recovery Manager**: Robust wake-up and state restoration

### 🆕 What Phase 2 Adds
- **Hooks-Aware Sleep Triggers**: Quality gates that trigger intelligent sleep cycles
- **Enhanced Context Preservation**: Extended thinking session memory across sleep cycles
- **Claude Code Memory Files**: Agent-specific AGENT.md files for persistent context
- **Sleep-Wake Slash Commands**: Direct control over agent lifecycle via commands
- **Quality-Gated Wake Cycles**: Hooks validation before agent reactivation
- **Thinking Session Persistence**: Collaborative problem-solving memory across cycles
