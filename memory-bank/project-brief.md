# Project Brief

## Purpose

HiveOps is a mobile-first dashboard for autonomous development operations. It targets entrepreneurial senior engineers who want to monitor and steer multi-agent workflows on side projects.

## Goals

- Provide real-time visibility into agent activity via WebSocket streams.
- Offer actionable controls and health overviews via REST APIs.
- Maintain a polished, professional brand and fast, responsive UX.

## Scope (Current)

- API/WS-only backend; server-rendered dashboard deprecated.
- PWA branded as “HiveOps,” integrated with `/api/dashboard/*` and compat `/dashboard/api/live-data`.
