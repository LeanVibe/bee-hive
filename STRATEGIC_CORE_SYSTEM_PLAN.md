## Testing & Quality Strategy

### **Test-Driven Development Approach**

```python
# Core System TDD Examples

async def test_enhanced_orchestrator_task_assignment():
    """Test intelligent task assignment with persona matching"""
    orchestrator = EnhancedAgentOrchestrator()
    
    # Create specialized agents
    backend_agent = await create_agent_with_persona("backend_engineer")
    frontend_agent = await create_agent_with_persona("frontend_developer")
    
    # Create backend-specific task
    task = Task(
        type=TaskType.CODE_GENERATION,
        required_capabilities=["api_development", "database_design"],
        complexity=0.8
    )
    
    # Should assign to backend agent based on persona affinity
    assigned_agent = await orchestrator.assign_optimal_task(task)
    assert assigned_agent.id == backend_agent.id
    assert assigned_agent.current_load < 0.8  # Load balancing check

async def test_hook_lifecycle_integration():
    """Test complete hook lifecycle with dangerous command blocking"""
    hook_system = HookLifecycleSystem()
    
    # Test dangerous command blocking
    dangerous_command = "rm -rf /"
    result = await hook_system.pre_tool_use("Bash", {"command": dangerous_command})
    assert result.blocked == True
    assert "dangerous command" in result.reason.lower()
    
    # Test normal command flow
    safe_command = "ls -la"
    pre_result = await hook_system.pre_tool_use("Bash", {"command": safe_command})
    assert pre_result.blocked == False
    
    # Simulate tool execution
    execution_result = {"output": "file1.txt\nfile2.txt", "exit_code": 0}
    post_result = await hook_system.post_tool_use("Bash", execution_result)
    
    # Verify events streamed to dashboard
    events = await hook_system.get_recent_events()
    assert len(events) == 2  # PreToolUse + PostToolUse
    assert events[0].event_type == "PreToolUse"
    assert events[1].event_type == "PostToolUse"

async def test_context_engine_consolidation():
    """Test context consolidation with memory optimization"""
    context_engine = CompleteContextEngine()
    
    # Create context with 10K tokens
    large_context = create_test_context(token_count=10000)
    
    # Trigger consolidation
    consolidated = await context_engine.consolidate_context(
        large_context, 
        target_reduction=0.7
    )
    
    # Verify 70% token reduction achieved
    assert consolidated.token_count <= 3000
    assert consolidated.semantic_integrity_score > 0.9
    
    # Verify embedding similarity maintained
    similarity = await context_engine.calculate_similarity(
        large_context, consolidated
    )
    assert similarity > 0.95
```

### **Performance Benchmarks**

```python
# Performance Test Requirements
async def test_orchestrator_performance_under_load():
    """Test orchestrator handles 100+ concurrent agents"""
    orchestrator = EnhancedAgentOrchestrator()
    
    # Spawn 100 agents
    agents = []
    for i in range(100):
        agent = await orchestrator.spawn_agent(f"agent-{i}")
        agents.append(agent)
    
    # Submit 1000 tasks concurrently  
    tasks = []
    start_time = time.time()
    
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
        for i in range(1000):
            task = tg.create_task(
                orchestrator.submit_task(create_test_task(f"task-{i}"))
            )
            tasks.append(task)
    
    end_time = time.time()
    
    # Performance assertions
    assert end_time - start_time < 60  # Complete in <60s
    assert all(task.result().status == "completed" for task in tasks)
    assert orchestrator.get_metrics().avg_assignment_time < 0.5  # <500ms
```
