# Multi-CLI Agent Coordination Testing Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the multi-CLI agent coordination system, designed to validate the transition from homogeneous Python agents to heterogeneous CLI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot).

### Current State vs. Vision
- **Current**: `[Orchestrator] → [Python Agent] → [Python Agent] → [Python Agent]`
- **Target**: `[Orchestrator] → [Claude Code Agent] → [Cursor Agent] → [Gemini CLI Agent]`

## Testing Framework Architecture

### 1. Universal Agent Interface Testing (`multi_cli_agent_testing_framework.py`)

**Purpose**: Validates standardized communication and agent adapter functionality across different CLI types.

**Key Components**:
- `CLIAgentAdapter` - Base adapter for CLI integration
- `MockCLIAgentAdapter` - Testing adapter with configurable behavior
- `ClaudeCodeAdapter` - Claude Code CLI integration
- `CursorAdapter` - Cursor CLI integration
- `MultiAgentOrchestrator` - Coordination management

**Test Coverage**:
- Message format standardization
- CLI-specific protocol translation
- Agent lifecycle management
- Error handling and recovery
- Context passing between agents

### 2. Git Worktree Isolation Testing (`git_worktree_isolation_tests.py`)

**Purpose**: Ensures proper security boundaries and prevents agents from accessing files outside their assigned worktrees.

**Key Components**:
- `WorktreeSecurityTester` - Security validation engine
- `GitWorktreeManager` - Worktree lifecycle management
- `WorktreeContext` - Isolation configuration

**Security Tests**:
- Path traversal attack prevention
- Symlink-based security attacks
- Concurrent worktree access
- Cleanup and integrity verification
- File system permission enforcement

### 3. Multi-Agent Coordination Scenarios (`multi_agent_coordination_scenarios.py`)

**Purpose**: Tests real-world development workflows with multiple coordinating agents.

**Workflow Patterns**:
- **Sequential**: Linear task handoff
- **Parallel**: Concurrent execution
- **Pipeline**: Streaming context flow
- **Conditional**: Decision-based execution
- **Recovery**: Failure handling and retry
- **Hybrid**: Complex mixed patterns

**Test Scenarios**:
- Feature development workflow
- Bug fixing process
- Code refactoring coordination
- Documentation generation
- Performance optimization

### 4. Communication Protocol Testing (`communication_protocol_tests.py`)

**Purpose**: Validates message standardization, Redis queue management, and WebSocket coordination.

**Protocol Components**:
- `StandardMessage` - Unified message format
- `ProtocolTranslator` - CLI format conversion
- `RedisQueueManager` - Queue reliability
- `WebSocketCoordinator` - Real-time coordination

**Test Areas**:
- Message translation accuracy
- Queue ordering and delivery
- WebSocket connection stability
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Protocol version compatibility

### 5. End-to-End Workflow Testing (`end_to_end_workflow_tests.py`)

**Purpose**: Validates complete development workflows from requirements to deployment.

**Workflow Types**:
- Feature development
- Bug fixing
- Code refactoring
- Documentation generation
- Testing and validation
- Performance optimization

**Validation Criteria**:
- File artifacts creation
- Code quality metrics
- Test coverage requirements
- Performance improvements
- Documentation completeness

### 6. Performance and Reliability Testing (`performance_reliability_tests.py`)

**Purpose**: Ensures system performance under various load conditions and validates scalability.

**Load Patterns**:
- Constant load
- Ramp-up testing
- Spike load handling
- Step load progression
- Random load distribution
- Burst traffic management

**Performance Metrics**:
- Response time (target: <5s)
- Throughput (target: >10 ops/sec)
- CPU usage (target: <80%)
- Memory usage (target: <1GB)
- Error rate (target: <5%)
- Agent utilization

### 7. Security and Isolation Testing (`security_isolation_tests.py`)

**Purpose**: Validates security boundaries, access controls, and vulnerability protection.

**Security Test Categories**:
- Code injection prevention
- Path traversal protection
- Command injection blocking
- Authentication validation
- Authorization enforcement
- Data exfiltration prevention
- Resource exhaustion protection

**Security Policies**:
- **Strict**: Minimal permissions, strict validation
- **Moderate**: Balanced security and functionality
- **Permissive**: Maximum functionality with basic protection
