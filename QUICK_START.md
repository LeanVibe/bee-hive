make setup-minimal      # Minimal setup for CI/CD (2-3 min)
make setup-full         # Complete setup with all tools (5-8 min)

# 3. Or traditional manual approach:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev,monitoring,ai-extended]

# 4. Start infrastructure with make commands
make start-minimal      # Start minimal services
make start-full         # Start all services including monitoring

# 5. Professional environment setup
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your settings

# 6. Database migrations handled by make
