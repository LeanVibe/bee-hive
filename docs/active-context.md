# Active Context

## Current Status
- Phase: Intake complete (Jan 20, 2026)
- Readiness: Production-ready (real-time dashboard, WebSocket, CLI)
- Blockers: None
- Priority: High (operational visibility tool, complements agent-hive/ant-farm)

## Next 3 Actions (Priority Order)
1. ✅ **Test dashboard and WebSocket** - COMPLETE: Testing script created and run (Dashboard, WebSocket, CLI all operational)
2. **Review technical debt tools** - Assess refactoring capabilities, document usage (2 tools found, demo available)
3. **Create deployment plan** - Infrastructure, domain, monitoring setup (use MONITORING_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

## Validation Focus (next 14 days)
- **Audience channel**: DevOps/engineering teams managing multi-agent systems
- **Primary metric**: Dashboard users (target: 5+), CLI installs (target: 10+)
- **Pass/fail gate**: 3+ teams use dashboard for real monitoring, provide feedback
- **Validation method**: Free access for teams using agent-hive/ant-farm, collect feedback

## Business Context
- **Competition**: Grafana, Datadog (but specialized for multi-agent systems)
- **Differentiator**: Real-time agent monitoring, unified CLI, technical debt tools
- **Revenue potential**: $199-799/month, often bundled with agent-hive/ant-farm
