- Click any breadcrumb to return to that level
- Context is preserved across navigation

### Session Management

Use the session selector to:
- View all sessions (`All Sessions`)
- Focus on specific session
- Automatically update all components with session context
- Maintain filters when switching sessions

## Feature Deep Dive

### Real-Time Updates

The dashboard maintains real-time connections to all data sources:

**Connection Status**: 
- Green dot: Connected and receiving updates
- Red dot: Connection issues (automatic reconnection attempts)
- Gray dot: No active connections

**Update Frequency**:
- Agent graph: Real-time node and edge updates
- Communications: Live message streaming
- Analysis: Pattern detection within 30 seconds
- Monitoring: System metrics every 10 seconds

### Error Handling and Fallbacks

The dashboard includes comprehensive error handling:

**Automatic Recovery**:
- Network errors trigger automatic retry with exponential backoff
- WebSocket disconnections attempt reconnection every 3 seconds
- Data errors show fallback content while recovery attempts continue

**Manual Recovery**:
- **Retry buttons** for failed components
- **Fallback mode** for degraded functionality
- **Error details** expandable for debugging

**Graceful Degradation**:
- Components continue working independently if others fail
- Cached data shown when live updates unavailable
- User notification of any service disruptions

### Performance Optimization

The dashboard optimizes performance through:

**Intelligent Batching**:
- Updates batched every 16ms (~60fps)
- Priority-based processing (critical > high > medium > low)
- Automatic dropping of low-priority updates during high load

**Memory Management**:
- Automatic cleanup of old data
- Configurable data retention periods
- Memory usage monitoring and alerts

**Visual Optimization**:
- Graph virtualization for large datasets
- Throttled updates for smooth animations
- Efficient re-rendering with Vue 3 reactivity

### Session Color Coding

Visual correlation across components through consistent coloring:

**Color Assignment**:
- Each session gets a unique color
- Colors persist across all dashboard components
- Agent nodes, message indicators, and UI elements match

**Color Accessibility**:
- High contrast ratios for readability
- Colorblind-friendly palette
- Alternative text indicators where needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Dashboard Not Loading
1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify WebSocket endpoints are accessible
3. Clear browser cache and reload
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

#### No Real-Time Updates
1. Verify connection status indicator (should be green)
2. Check that agents are actively running
3. Refresh the page to restart connections
4. Contact administrator if issue persists

#### Graph Not Displaying
1. Ensure there are active agents in the selected session
2. Try different layout algorithms
3. Reset zoom and pan to default view
4. Check for browser compatibility (requires modern browser)

#### Performance Issues
1. Reduce time window for communications view
2. Filter to specific agents or sessions
3. Disable real-time updates temporarily
4. Clear browser cache and reload

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Filtering

Create sophisticated filters across all components:

```javascript
// Example: Filter to specific agents with high activity
{
  sessionIds: ["session_123"],
  agentIds: ["agent_001", "agent_002"],
  eventTypes: ["tool_call", "coordination"],
  timeRange: { start: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z" },
  includeInactive: false
}
```

### Performance Monitoring

Track dashboard performance through built-in metrics:

- **Queue Length**: Number of pending updates
- **Processing Time**: Average update processing time
- **Frame Rate**: Visual rendering performance
- **Memory Usage**: Browser memory consumption

### API Integration

Access dashboard data programmatically:

```javascript
// Get current graph data
const graphData = await coordinationService.getGraphData()

// Subscribe to real-time updates
coordinationService.on('graph_update', (data) => {
  console.log('Graph updated:', data)
})

// Create custom event handlers
navigation.onNavigation('tab_changed', (context) => {
  console.log('Navigated to:', context.targetComponent)
})
```

### Debugging Integration

Use built-in debugging tools:

1. **Event Replay**: Replay communication sequences
