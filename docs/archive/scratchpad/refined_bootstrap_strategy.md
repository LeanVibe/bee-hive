# LeanVibe Agent Hive 2.0 - Refined Bootstrap Strategy

## üéØ Strategic Pivot Based on Gemini CLI Validation

**DECISION**: Implementing dual-track approach based on strategic analysis by Gemini CLI
- **Track 1**: Demo-ready capability (4-6 hours) - HIGH PRIORITY
- **Track 2**: Full autonomous coordination (1-2 days) - MEDIUM PRIORITY

**RATIONALE**: Maximize client demonstration success while building toward full platform vision

## üöÄ Track 1: Demo-Ready Implementation (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)

### Objective: Compelling Demonstration Within 4-6 Hours

**Core Value Proposition**: Prove intelligent specialized agent capability with manual coordination handoffs

### Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure (90 minutes - TIME BOXED)
#### API Connectivity Resolution - SYSTEMATIC APPROACH

**Gemini-Recommended Diagnostic Sequence**:
```bash
# Step 1: Container logs analysis (15 minutes)
docker logs $(docker ps | grep python | awk '{print $1}') --tail 100

# Step 2: Port binding verification (10 minutes)  
docker exec -it <container> netstat -tulpn | grep 8000
lsof -i :8000

# Step 3: Internal connectivity test (10 minutes)
docker exec -it <container> curl http://localhost:8000/docs

# Step 4: Docker configuration validation (15 minutes)
# Check docker-compose.yml ports section
# Verify environment variables and startup command

# Step 5: Host firewall assessment (15 minutes)
# Temporarily disable macOS firewall
sudo pfctl -d  # Disable firewall temporarily for testing

# Step 6: Manual service restart (15 minutes)
cd /Users/bogdan/work/leanvibe-dev/bee-hive
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**CRITICAL DECISION POINT (90 minutes)**:
- ‚úÖ **If Resolved**: Proceed to Phase 2
- ‚ùå **If Unresolved**: Escalate and implement BACKUP DEMO PLAN

#### BACKUP DEMO PLAN (If API Issues Persist)
```bash
# Direct Python execution without Docker
cd /Users/bogdan/work/leanvibe-dev/bee-hive
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001

# Alternative: CLI-only demonstration
# Use agent-hive CLI commands to demonstrate capabilities
# Focus on individual agent intelligence without API layer
```

### Phase 2: Single Agent Validation (2 hours)
#### Prove Core Agent Intelligence

**Target**: One specialized agent completing valuable development task end-to-end

**Demonstration Scenario**:
```
Agent Role: Backend Developer
Task: "Create a REST API for user authentication with JWT tokens"
Expected Output:
- Complete Python/FastAPI implementation
- Database models and migrations  
- Authentication middleware
- API documentation
- Unit tests
```

**Validation Steps**:
1. Spawn single Backend Developer agent via API/CLI
2. Assign specific development task
3. Monitor agent execution and decision-making
4. Validate deliverable quality and completeness
5. Document agent reasoning and process

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Agent produces working, testable code
- ‚úÖ Solution demonstrates domain expertise
- ‚úÖ Agent explains decisions and rationale
- ‚úÖ Output ready for manual handoff to next agent

### Phase 3: Manual Handoff Workflow (1.5 hours)
#### Demonstrate Multi-Agent Value Through Manual Coordination

**Demonstration Flow**:
```
1. Backend Developer Agent ‚Üí Complete API implementation
2. [Manual Handoff] ‚Üí Human copies/reviews output
3. QA Engineer Agent ‚Üí Create comprehensive test suite for API
4. [Manual Handoff] ‚Üí Human integrates tests
5. DevOps Engineer Agent ‚Üí Create deployment configuration
6. [Final Integration] ‚Üí Complete deployable solution
```

**Manual Handoff Process**:
- Human reviewer examines Agent A output
- Transfers relevant context to Agent B
- Agent B receives "clean" input and produces output
- Process demonstrates agent specialization value

**Key Advantages**:
- ‚úÖ Removes complex coordination failure points
- ‚úÖ Highlights individual agent intelligence
- ‚úÖ Shows clear path to full automation
- ‚úÖ Allows human oversight and quality control

### Phase 4: Demo Script Preparation (1 hour)
#### Compelling Client Demonstration

**Demo Narrative Structure**:
1. **Problem Introduction** (2 minutes)
   - "Building software requires diverse expertise"
   - "Traditional approach: hire multiple specialists"
   - "Agent Hive approach: AI specialists on-demand"

2. **Individual Agent Showcase** (8 minutes)
   - Backend Developer creates complete API
   - QA Engineer builds comprehensive test suite  
   - DevOps Engineer configures deployment
   - Each agent explains its domain expertise

3. **Integration Demonstration** (5 minutes)
   - Manual handoffs show coordination potential
   - Final integrated solution deployment
   - Quality and completeness validation

4. **Vision & Roadmap** (5 minutes)
   - Current: Manual coordination, proven agents
   - Next: Automated coordination, full autonomy
   - Future: Enterprise scale, multi-tenant

**Demo Success Metrics**:
- ‚úÖ Audience understands agent capability
- ‚úÖ Clear value proposition established
- ‚úÖ Path to full automation evident
- ‚úÖ Client engagement and questions generated
