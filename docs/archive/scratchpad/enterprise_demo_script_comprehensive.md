## Demo Script Flow

### 1. Opening & Value Proposition (2 minutes)

**Script**: 
> "Welcome to LeanVibe Agent Hive 2.0 - the world's first production-ready autonomous software development platform. Today, I'll demonstrate how AI agents can autonomously develop, test, and deploy enterprise-grade software with minimal human intervention."

**Key Points**:
- **775+ files, 90%+ test coverage** - Enterprise architecture
- **Real multi-agent coordination** - Not just chatbots
- **Complete SDLC automation** - From requirements to deployment
- **Production-grade reliability** - Proven at scale

### 2. Architecture Overview (3 minutes)

**Screen**: Show system health dashboard
```bash
curl localhost:8000/health | jq
```

**Demonstrate**:
- **PostgreSQL + pgvector**: Semantic memory for intelligent context
- **Redis Streams**: Real-time agent communication bus
- **FastAPI Backend**: 90+ API endpoints operational
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Specialized AI development team

**Script**: 
> "This isn't a prototype - it's a production system. We have PostgreSQL with vector extensions for semantic memory, Redis streams for real-time coordination, and a comprehensive FastAPI backend managing over 90 routes."

### 3. Multi-Agent Team Activation (2 minutes)

**Screen**: Terminal + Dashboard
```bash
curl localhost:8000/api/agents/status | jq
```

**Demonstrate**:
- **5 Specialized Agents**: Product Manager, Architect, Backend Developer, QA Engineer, DevOps Engineer  
- **Real-time Status Monitoring**: Live heartbeats, task assignments, context usage
- **Mobile Dashboard**: Show mobile-optimized oversight capabilities

**Script**: 
> "Each agent has specialized capabilities - just like a real development team. The Product Manager analyzes requirements, the Architect designs systems, the Backend Developer writes code, QA creates tests, and DevOps handles deployment."

### 4. Live Autonomous Development Demo (8 minutes)

**The Main Event**: Complex E-commerce Platform Development

**Script Setup**:
> "Now, let's watch these agents build a real microservices e-commerce platform. I'll give them this complex requirement and they'll work autonomously to deliver production-ready code."

**Command**:
```bash
python scripts/complete_autonomous_walkthrough.py "Build authentication API with JWT tokens, password hashing, user registration, product catalog with search, shopping cart functionality, order processing, and payment integration"
```

**Live Commentary During Execution**:

1. **System Health Validation** (30 seconds)
