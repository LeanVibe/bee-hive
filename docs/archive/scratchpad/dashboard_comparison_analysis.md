### **Mobile PWA Dashboard** ❌ **BROKEN**
- **Location**: `localhost:3002`  
- **Status**: ❌ **CRITICAL FAILURE**
- **Playwright Tests**: ❌ **0/7 PASSED**

#### Theoretical Strengths:
🔧 **Sophisticated Architecture**: 981-line Lit framework implementation  
🔧 **PWA Features**: Service worker, offline support, mobile optimization  
🔧 **Modern Stack**: TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, comprehensive tooling  
🔧 **Enterprise Components**: Advanced agent management, kanban boards, charts  

#### Critical Issues:
❌ **JavaScript Runtime Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'properties')`  
❌ **Service Worker Failure**: PWA service worker generation crashes  
❌ **No User Interface**: App element hidden due to errors  
❌ **Zero Functionality**: Complete failure to display any dashboard content  
❌ **Backend Disconnection**: No successful API calls to working endpoints  
❌ **Development Incomplete**: Multiple duplicate methods, unresolved dependencies

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL ANALYSIS**

### Current Backend Integration Status:

**Simple Dashboard APIs** ✅:
- `GET /dashboard/api/live-data` → Working, returns real agent data
- `WebSocket /dashboard/simple-ws/` → Working, real-time updates
- Integration with `/app/core/agent_spawner.py` → Working

**Mobile PWA APIs** ❌:
- `GET /api/v1/*` → Endpoints don't exist
- `WebSocket /ws/observability` → Connection not established
- Service calls fail before reaching backend

### Error Root Cause:
The mobile PWA crashes during service worker initialization due to Workbox configuration issues:
```
betterAjvErrors → validate → validateGenerateSWOptions → generateSW
```
