# Scratchpad Digest (Key Ideas → Actions)

This digest captures meaningful ideas from archived scratchpad docs and maps them to concrete actions in core docs (`docs/TODO.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`).

## High-value extracts (captured into core docs)

- Infrastructure implementation roadmap (`infrastructure_implementation_roadmap.md`)
  - Key ideas: K8s security (PSS, RBAC, network policies), HPA/VPA using custom metrics, External Secrets, cert-manager, multi-cloud IaC, tracing, ML-based alerting, DR/backup.
  - Actions:
    - ARCHITECTURE: Added optional enterprise deployment & observability section.
    - TODO (Later): IaC scaffolding (Helm/Terraform), DR scripts, tracing/alerting hooks.

- 90-day roadmap (`comprehensive_90_day_roadmap_2025-08-07.md`)
  - Key ideas: Phase plan; agent lifecycle, continuous coordination, context engine perf, enterprise readiness.
  - Actions:
    - PRD (Later): Backlog highlights appended.
    - TODO (Next/Later): Agent lifecycle service, continuous coordinator, context engine optimization.

- Backend engineering gap analysis (`comprehensive_backend_engineering_gap_analysis_2025-08-06.md`)
  - Key ideas: Missing autonomous APIs (project mgmt, code intelligence, deploy, learning), API hardening, DB perf, MQ reliability (DLQ, monitoring), scalability patterns, GitHub integration.
  - Actions:
    - PRD (Later): Backlog highlights include API/messaging gaps.
    - TODO (Later): Track API surface, DLQ, pool tuning, cache strategy.

- Mobile dashboard validation (`mobile_dashboard_comprehensive_validation_report.md`)
  - Key ideas: WS endpoint fix, FCM tests, UI/UX standards, test env issues (server stability, selectors, SW in dev).
  - Actions:
    - TODO (Now): Stabilize backend during e2e, align selectors, add test config for SW.

- Coordination monitoring QA guide (`coordination_monitoring_dashboard_qa_validation_guide.md`)
  - Key ideas: Live coordination monitoring endpoints and tests; recovery controls; performance targets.
  - Actions:
    - PRD (Later): Coordination monitoring as future feature; not reintroducing server-rendered dashboard.

- Context engine plan (`context_engine_implementation_plan.md`)
  - Key ideas: Context compression (60–80%), temporal windows, cross-agent knowledge sharing, <50ms retrieval.
  - Actions:
    - PRD (Later): Added to backlog highlights.
    - TODO (Later): Performance and compression tasks.

- Autonomous development validation (`autonomous_development_validation_report.md`)
  - Key ideas: Connect dashboard to enhanced coordination APIs; persistent agents; always-on coordinator.
  - Actions:
    - TODO (Next): Agent lifecycle service; coordinator scheduler; PWA service refactor for enhanced APIs.

- Integration ecosystem deployment (`integration_ecosystem_deployment_report.md`)
  - Key ideas: VS Code extension, GH Actions, Docker, AWS, K8s—network effects.
  - Actions:
    - PRD (Later): Integrations as strategic accelerators; index/manifest references kept.

- Strategic competitive response (`strategic_competitive_response_plan.md`)
  - Key ideas: Differentiation via advanced autonomy, enterprise features, ecosystem moat.
  - Actions:
    - PRD (Later): Competitive themes reflected; no immediate engineering action.

## Other scratchpad files (categorized)

- Validation and QA reports (keep as reference):
  - `comprehensive_dashboard_testing_validation_report.md`, `dashboard_comprehensive_validation_report.md`, `performance_intelligence_validation_report.md`, `phase2_comprehensive_validation_report.md`, `phase2_validation_summary.md`, `phase3_intelligence_layer_completion_report.md`, `mobile_pwa_optimization_completion_report.md`, `manual_dashboard_testing_instructions.md`, `dashboard_fixes_validation_report.md`.
  - Action: No net-new beyond TODO Now items for e2e stability/selectors.

- Plans and summaries (captured conceptually in PRD backlog):
  - `multi_agent_dashboard_development_plan.md`, `multi_agent_dashboard_development_executive_summary.md`, `frontend_critical_implementation_gaps_analysis.md`, `pragmatic_dx_enhancement_plan.md`, `enhanced_mobile_pwa_dashboard_completion_report.md`, `focused_dashboard_implementation_plan.md`, `focused_mobile_pwa_testing_plan.md`.
  - Action: Covered by PRD backlog highlights and TODO Next design/polish.

- Observability and infra analyses (captured in ARCHITECTURE enterprise section):
  - `observability_system_implementation_complete.md`, `observability_stack_evaluation.md`, `observability_hooks_completion_report.md`, `observability_prd_verification_report.md`, `observability_sentinels_analysis.md`, `devops_infrastructure_assessment_report.md`.
  - Action: Optional enterprise deployment/observability; no change to default local setup.

- Context/engine/back-end roadmaps (captured in PRD/TODO later):
  - `context_engine_implementation_plan.md`, `comprehensive_testing_infrastructure_*`, `self_modification_safety_systems_work_package.md`, `integration_ecosystem_deployment_report.md`, `infrastructure_implementation_roadmap.md`, `container_native_*`, `core_infrastructure_evaluation_2025-08-06.md`.
  - Action: PRD backlog; TODO Later.

- Executive/strategy/competitive docs (kept for reference):
  - `business_value_assessment_report.md`, `strategic_delegation_recommendations.md`, `strategic_compounding_impact_analysis_definitive_backlog.md`, `competitive_analysis_opencode_vs_leanvibe.md`, `enterprise_*` reports.
  - Action: No changes to core engineering docs; strategy noted in PRD.

- Misc implementation logs and fixes (reference only):
  - `dashboard_ui_specifications_extracted.md`, `database_enum_fix_summary.md`, `lit_component_fixes.md`, `sidebar_svg_fix_implementation_report.md`.
  - Action: No net-new; keep archived.

If a specific scratchpad document needs deeper extraction into core docs, point me to it—I’ll fold it into `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, or expand `docs/TODO.md` accordingly.
