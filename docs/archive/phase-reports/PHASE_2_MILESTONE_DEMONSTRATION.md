## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Redis Connection Issues
```bash
# Check Redis server status
redis-cli ping

# Verify Redis configuration
redis-cli info server

# Clear test databases
redis-cli -n 14 flushdb
redis-cli -n 15 flushdb
```

#### Database Connection Issues  
```bash
# Test database connection
python -c "from app.core.database import get_session; print('DB OK')"

# Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Reset test data
python scripts/reset_demo_data.py
```

#### Import/Module Issues
```bash
# Verify Python path
echo $PYTHONPATH

# Install missing dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Rebuild Python cache
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
find . -name "__pycache__" -delete
```

### Performance Issues

#### Low Throughput
- Increase Redis connection pool size
- Enable Redis pipelining
- Optimize batch sizes in workflow engine
- Check network latency between components

#### Slow Recovery Times
- Reduce health check intervals
- Optimize consumer group rebalancing
- Increase consumer provisioning speed
- Check Redis memory usage

    4. Create parallel execution batches
    5. Analyze critical path for optimization
    6. Generate execution plan with resource allocation

def handle_consumer_crash(consumer_id: str) -> RecoveryPlan:
    """
    Multi-stage crash recovery process:
    
    1. Detect consumer failure (heartbeat timeout)
    2. Mark consumer as failed in group registry
    3. Claim pending messages from failed consumer
    4. Redistribute messages to healthy consumers
