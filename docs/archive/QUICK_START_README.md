# Quick Start README (Archived)

> DEPRECATED: Consolidated into `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`. Use that guide for the up-to-date, tested instructions.

Use the consolidated docs instead:

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — startup, services, health
- `docs/CORE.md` — purpose, value, scope
- `docs-site/learn/getting-started/setup.md` — docs-site guide
