# XP Methodology Action Plan: LeanVibe Agent Hive 2.0
## Date: August 1, 2025

## üéØ Executive Summary: Project Reality Check

**Current Status**: **Working System with Critical Technical Debt**  
**XP Readiness**: **3/10 - Not Ready for Continuous Refactoring**  
**Overall Assessment**: **7.5/10 Functionality, 2/10 XP Methodology Compliance**

### Key Findings from Comprehensive Analysis

**‚úÖ What Actually Works** (Better than expected):
