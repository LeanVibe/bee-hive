# Sandbox Mode Architecture Design

## Overview
Design a comprehensive sandbox mode that eliminates API key barriers and provides immediate autonomous development demonstration without requiring real credentials.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Sandbox Detection & Configuration
```python
# Automatic sandbox mode detection
class SandboxConfig:
    - Auto-detect missing API keys
    - Enable sandbox mode by default for demos
    - Provide clear sandbox vs production indicators
    - Allow manual override for testing
```

### 2. Mock API Layer
```python
# Mock Anthropic Client
class MockAnthropicClient:
    - Realistic response generation
    - Simulated processing time
    - Context-aware responses based on task type
    - Progressive conversation simulation

# Mock External Services
class MockServicesLayer:
    - GitHub API simulation
    - Database operations (optional mock)
    - Redis operations (optional mock)
    - File system operations (safe sandbox)
```

### 3. Demo Scenario Engine
```python
# Pre-defined Demo Scenarios
class DemoScenarioEngine:
    - Multi-agent autonomous development
    - End-to-end feature development
    - Bug fixing and testing workflows
    - Documentation generation
    - Code review and optimization
```

### 4. Realistic Simulation Engine
```python
# Timing and Progress Simulation
class SimulationEngine:
    - Realistic processing delays
    - Progressive status updates
    - Multi-agent coordination visualization
    - Failure/recovery scenarios
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Sandbox Infrastructure
1. Create sandbox configuration detection
2. Implement mock Anthropic client with realistic responses
3. Build scenario-based response system
4. Add sandbox indicators to UI

### Phase 2: Demo Scenarios
1. Autonomous development scenarios
2. Multi-agent coordination demos
3. End-to-end feature development
4. Error handling and recovery demos

### Phase 3: User Experience
1. Zero-friction demo startup
2. Professional quality demonstrations
3. Sandbox-to-production migration
4. Documentation and guides

## Technical Requirements

### Mock Response Quality
- Context-aware AI responses
- Realistic code generation
- Progressive conversation flows
- Error simulation for testing

### Performance Simulation
- Realistic timing delays (2-10 seconds per phase)
- Progressive status updates every 500ms
- Multi-agent coordination visualization
- Resource usage simulation

### Demo Scenarios
- **Simple**: Function implementation (Fibonacci, temperature converter)
- **Moderate**: Multi-file features (user authentication, data processing)
- **Complex**: Full application features (REST API, database integration)
- **Enterprise**: Multi-service architecture, deployment automation

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- Demo works within 30 seconds of setup
- No API key requirements for initial experience
- Professional quality that impresses evaluators
- Clear path to production usage

### Technical Quality
- 100% feature coverage in sandbox mode
- Realistic simulation of all autonomous development phases
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Performance matches or exceeds production expectations
