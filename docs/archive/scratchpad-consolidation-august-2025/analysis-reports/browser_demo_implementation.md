# Browser-Based Instant Demo Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
Creating a browser-based instant demo that showcases LeanVibe Agent Hive 2.0's autonomous development capabilities in <2 minutes with zero setup required.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Single-Page Application)
- **Technology**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript for maximum compatibility
- **UI Framework**: Modern CSS Grid/Flexbox with Tailwind-like utilities
- **Real-time Updates**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for progress streaming
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly interfaces

### Backend Integration
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/demo/autonomous-development` (POST)
- **Progress Streaming**: `/api/demo/progress/{session_id}` (SSE)
- **File Downloads**: `/api/demo/download/{session_id}` (GET)

### User Experience Flow

1. **Landing (0-15s)**
   - Compelling hero section with value proposition
   - Simple task input field (pre-filled with examples)
   - One-click "Start Autonomous Development" button

2. **Development Phase (15s-90s)**
   - Real-time progress visualization with phases
   - Live code generation display (streaming)
   - Visual indicators for each development phase
   - Progress percentage and estimated completion time

3. **Results & Success (90s-120s)**
   - Generated code preview with syntax highlighting
   - Test results and validation status
   - Download bundle with all artifacts
   - Clear next steps to get started locally
