# System Status - Current Working Features & Limitations

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Status**: Working Prototype - Active Development

## üöÄ What's Working Today

### ‚úÖ Core Infrastructure
- **FastAPI Application**: Main API server imports and runs successfully
- **Docker Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL + Redis services operational via Docker Compose
- **Agent Orchestrator**: Basic multi-agent coordination system functional
- **Database Schema**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic memory
- **Redis Messaging**: Stream-based agent communication system

### ‚úÖ Demonstrations & Sandbox
- **Autonomous Development Demo**: Multiple demo scripts available in `scripts/demos/`
- **Sandbox Mode**: Interactive autonomous development (requires API key)
- **Standalone Demos**: Self-contained demonstrations of agent coordination
- **Multi-Agent Examples**: Working examples of AI agents collaborating

### ‚úÖ Development Environment
- **Professional Setup**: Make-based command system
- **DevContainer Support**: VS Code development container configuration
- **Test Framework**: Pytest-based testing infrastructure
- **Code Quality**: SwiftLint integration, structured logging

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### Test Suite Status (27% Pass Rate)
- **Import Errors**: 17 test collection failures due to missing modules
- **Database Integration**: Health check failures, model inconsistencies  
- **API Endpoints**: 422 errors on basic CRUD operations
- **Security Components**: SecurityManager and related classes need implementation

### Setup Requirements
- **API Keys**: Anthropic API key required for full autonomous functionality
- **Configuration**: Some components require manual configuration
- **Troubleshooting**: May need 15-30 minutes including issue resolution
- **Dependencies**: Python 3.12, Docker, specific package versions

### Development Limitations
- **Production Readiness**: Prototype status, not production-deployed
- **Error Handling**: Some failure modes not fully handled
- **Documentation**: Some features have limited documentation
- **Performance**: Not optimized for production workloads

## üîß Current Development Focus

### Stability & Reliability
- Fixing test suite import errors and failures
- Improving database integration and health checks
- Stabilizing API endpoint functionality
- Enhanced error handling and recovery

### User Experience
- Streamlining setup process
- Better error messages and troubleshooting guides
- Improved documentation accuracy
- More robust sandbox mode

### Feature Development
- Advanced multi-agent coordination capabilities
- Enhanced GitHub integration
- Improved context memory and learning
- Production deployment readiness

## üìã Feature Status Matrix

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Basic Agent Orchestration | ‚úÖ Working | Core functionality operational |
| Multi-Agent Demos | ‚úÖ Working | Multiple working demonstrations |
| FastAPI Server | ‚úÖ Working | Main application runs successfully |
| Docker Infrastructure | ‚úÖ Working | PostgreSQL + Redis operational |
| Sandbox Mode | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited | Requires API key configuration |
| Test Suite | ‚ùå Issues | 27% pass rate, import errors |
| API Endpoints | ‚ùå Issues | CRUD operations failing |
| Production Deploy | ‚ùå Not Ready | Prototype status |
| Enterprise Security | ‚ùå Not Ready | Development needed |

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Setup Reality Check

### What You Can Expect
- **5-15 minutes**: Basic setup if everything works smoothly
- **15-30 minutes**: Realistic time including troubleshooting
- **Additional time**: May be needed for specific environment issues

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Python 3.12 with pip/uv package manager
- Anthropic API key for full autonomous features
- Basic command line familiarity

### Success Indicators
- ‚úÖ `docker compose ps` shows healthy postgres and redis services
- ‚úÖ `python -c "from app.main import app; print('‚úÖ App imports')"` succeeds
- ‚úÖ Demo scripts in `scripts/demos/` can be executed
- ‚úÖ API server responds at `http://localhost:8000/health`

## üÜò When Things Don't Work

### Common Issues
1. **Import Errors**: Some advanced features may have missing dependencies
2. **Database Connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL service is running
3. **API Key**: Sandbox mode requires valid Anthropic API key
4. **Port Conflicts**: Default ports 8000, 5432, 6379 must be available

### Getting Help
- **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs and request features
- **GitHub Discussions**: Ask questions and share experiences
- **System Health**: Run `make health` for diagnostic information
- **Logs**: Check `docker compose logs` for service issues

## üéØ User Recommendations

### For Evaluators
- Focus on the working demos and core infrastructure
- Understand this is a prototype with significant potential
- Evaluate the architectural foundation and development approach
- Consider the roadmap and development trajectory

### For Developers
- Explore the working components first
- Contribute to fixing known issues
- Build on the stable foundation
- Help improve test coverage and documentation

### For Users
- Start with sandbox mode and demos
- Set appropriate expectations (prototype, not production)
- Provide feedback on what works and what doesn't
- Be patient with setup and configuration issues

---

**Remember**: This is a working prototype demonstrating autonomous development capabilities. The value lies in the working demonstrations, architectural foundation, and development potential, not in production-ready stability.

**Next Steps**: Explore the demos, try the sandbox mode, and contribute to making the system more reliable and user-friendly.
