    """
    Integration of Claude Code hooks pattern with LeanVibe workflows
    """
    
    async def register_workflow_hooks(self, workflow_id: str, hooks: List[WorkflowHook]):
        """
        Register hooks for specific workflow events:
        - PreAgentTask: Validation before agent task execution
        - PostAgentTask: Quality checks after task completion
        - AgentError: Error handling and recovery
        - WorkflowComplete: Final validation and notifications
        """
        
    async def execute_hook(self, event: HookEvent, context: HookContext) -> HookResult:
        """
        Execute registered hooks with proper security validation
        """
```

**Specific Hook Implementations**:

```yaml
leanvibe_workflow_hooks:
  PreAgentTask:
    - name: "security_validation"
      command: "python .leanvibe/hooks/validate_security.py"
      matcher: "*" 
      description: "Validate task doesn't access sensitive files"
      
    - name: "dependency_check"
      command: "python .leanvibe/hooks/check_dependencies.py"
      matcher: "backend_*"
      description: "Ensure required dependencies are available"
      
  PostAgentTask:
    - name: "code_formatting"
      command: "python .leanvibe/hooks/format_code.py"
      matcher: "*_specialist"
      description: "Auto-format code according to project standards"
      
    - name: "test_execution"
      command: "python .leanvibe/hooks/run_tests.py"
      matcher: "*"
      description: "Run relevant tests for changed code"
      
  WorkflowComplete:
    - name: "quality_report"
      command: "python .leanvibe/hooks/generate_quality_report.py"
      description: "Generate comprehensive quality and progress report"
      
    - name: "notification"
      command: "python .leanvibe/hooks/send_notifications.py"
