## Architecture Overview

### Integration Stack
```
Frontend (dashboard.html)
    â†“ WebSocket Connection
WebSocket Manager (connection_manager)
    â†“ Real-time Data
Dashboard Backend (coordination_dashboard.py)
    â†“ Data Collection
Coordination Engine (coordination.py)
    â†“ Multi-Agent Data
