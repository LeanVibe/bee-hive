## üéØ What Kind of Experience Do You Want?

**Choose based on how much time you have and what you want to achieve:**

### üéÆ **"Let me try it first"** (0 minutes)
**Perfect for:** Exploring without any installation  
**Experience:** [Sandbox Mode](docs/SANDBOX_MODE_GUIDE.md) - Interactive autonomous development in your browser  
**What you get:** Hands-on experience with AI agents building features  
**Next step:** Come back here when ready for local setup

### üõ†Ô∏è **"Get me building now"** (2-15 minutes)  
**Perfect for:** Developers who want working autonomous development quickly  
**Experience:** [Developer Setup](docs/developer/) - Architecture, APIs, customization  
**What you get:** Local autonomous development system, full control, extensibility  
**Next step:** Customize agents for your specific development needs

### üíº **"Show me the business case"** (5-10 minutes)
**Perfect for:** Executives, PMs, decision makers  
**Experience:** [Executive Brief](docs/executive/) - ROI, competitive analysis, implementation planning  
**What you get:** Business justification, resource requirements, success metrics  
**Next step:** Pilot program planning or team rollout strategy

### üè¢ **"Enterprise evaluation"** (15-30 minutes)
**Perfect for:** Enterprise architects, security teams, IT leadership  
**Experience:** [Enterprise Assessment](docs/enterprise/) - Security, compliance, scalability  
**What you get:** Deployment architecture, security analysis, integration requirements  
**Next step:** Enterprise deployment planning and pilot setup

## ü§î Still Deciding? Here's What You Should Know

### What Makes This Actually Work
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Specialized AI agents (architect, developer, tester, reviewer) collaborate
- **Complete autonomy**: Requirements ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment with minimal human intervention
- **Context memory**: Agents learn your patterns and improve over time
- **Self-healing**: Automatic error recovery and intelligent retry logic

### Current Capabilities
- **Working autonomous development** - Functional prototype with demonstrable AI agent coordination
- **Professional architecture** - Clean, test-driven development foundation with ongoing improvements
- **DevContainer support** - Streamlined setup process for quick exploration
- **Docker-based infrastructure** - Reliable containerized development environment

### Common Questions

**Q: How is this different from GitHub Copilot/Cursor?**  
A: Those are code assistance tools. This is end-to-end autonomous development with AI agents that handle complete feature cycles.

**Q: Is it production-ready?**  
A: It's a working prototype suitable for development and exploration. Production deployment requires additional configuration and testing.

**Q: What's the learning curve?**  
A: 5-10 minutes for sandbox exploration, 15-30 minutes for local setup, and progressive learning as you explore features.

## üöÄ Or Just Get Started Now

### Quick Setup (For the Impatient)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeanVibe/bee-hive.git && cd bee-hive
make setup
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env.local
python scripts/demos/autonomous_development_demo.py
```

### DevContainer (Zero Configuration)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeanVibe/bee-hive.git
code bee-hive  # Opens in VS Code - click "Reopen in Container"
```

**Both result in working autonomous development at http://localhost:8000**
