# Universal Project Index Installer - Complete Implementation

## üéØ Mission Accomplished: One-Command Project Index Installation

We have successfully implemented a **universal Project Index installer** that makes it effortless to install the Project Index to any existing project with a single command. This implementation leverages the bee-hive project as a publicly available reference and provides a seamless, zero-friction installation experience.

## üöÄ The Solution: Single Command Installation

```bash
# One command to rule them all
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanvibe/bee-hive/main/install.sh | bash
```

This single command:
1. **Detects your project** (language, framework, structure)
2. **Sets up infrastructure** (Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis)
3. **Generates configuration** (optimized for your project)
4. **Integrates with framework** (1-3 lines of code)
5. **Validates installation** (comprehensive health checks)
6. **Provides working examples** (ready-to-use API calls)

# Verify installation
curl http://localhost:8100/health
```

### **Framework Integration Examples**

**FastAPI (Python)**:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from project_index.integrations.fastapi import add_project_index

app = FastAPI()
add_project_index(app)  # That's it!
```

**Express.js (JavaScript)**:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { addProjectIndex } = require('project-index/express');

const app = express();
addProjectIndex(app);  // One line integration
```

**Django (Python)**:
```python
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS += ['project_index.integrations.django']

# urls.py
from project_index.integrations.django import project_index_urls
urlpatterns += project_index_urls
```

### **API Usage Examples**
```bash
# Analyze your project
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/api/v1/projects/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project_path": "/path/to/project"}'

# Get dependency graph
curl http://localhost:8100/api/v1/projects/dependencies?format=graph

# Real-time monitoring
wscat -c ws://localhost:8100/ws
```
