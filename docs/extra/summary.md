# LeanVibe Agent Hive 2.0 - Complete Setup Summary

## 📦 What You Have

You now have all the documentation and prompts needed to build a self-improving multi-agent system using Claude Code.

### Documentation Files Created:

1. **README.md** - System overview and architecture
2. **IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Detailed step-by-step implementation guide
3. **.claude/CLAUDE.md** - Context and patterns for Claude Code
4. **PROMPTS.md** - Specific prompts for generating each component
5. **QUICKSTART.md** - Quick setup instructions
6. **bootstrap.sh** - Automated setup script

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Super Quick Start (2 minutes)
```bash
# Create project
mkdir leanvibe-hive && cd leanvibe-hive

# Get the Makefile and setup
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../Makefile
make setup

# Generate with Claude Code
make generate

# Start everything
make quick  # This runs: setup, up, bootstrap, start, logs
```

### Step 2: Using Docker Compose

Everything runs in containers - no local dependencies needed!

```bash
# Start core services
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# Run bootstrap
docker-compose run --rm bootstrap

# Start full system
docker-compose --profile production up -d

# Watch it build itself
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation
```bash
# Check health
make health

# Run tests
make test

# View dashboard
open http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## 🎯 Key Success Factors

### 1. Bootstrap First
The bootstrap agent is critical - it's the first agent that creates all others. Make sure it can:
- Execute Claude Code commands
- Track progress in Redis
- Generate other components
- Handle errors gracefully

### 2. Test Everything
Every component should have tests. The system should maintain >90% test coverage:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### 3. Enable Self-Improvement Early
As soon as the Meta-Agent is running, have it start improving the system:
```bash
# Submit improvement task
hive task submit --type "analyze_and_improve" --priority 1
```

### 4. Monitor Continuously
Watch the system build itself:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Watch logs
tail -f logs/hive.log

# Terminal 2: Monitor Redis
redis-cli MONITOR

# Terminal 3: Check agent status
watch -n 5 'hive agent list'
```

## 🔄 Self-Building Process

Once bootstrapped, the system will:

1. **Hour 1-2**: Create core infrastructure
   - Task queue operational
   - Basic agent communication
   - Database models created

2. **Hour 3-4**: Spawn specialized agents
   - Meta-Agent analyzing system
   - Developer agents creating code
   - QA agents writing tests

3. **Hour 5-6**: Self-improvement begins
   - First optimization proposals
   - Prompt improvements
   - Performance enhancements

4. **Day 2+**: Autonomous operation
   - 24/7 task processing
   - Continuous improvements
   - Self-documentation

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### If Claude Code times out:
```bash
# Increase timeout
claude --timeout 600 "your prompt here"

# Or break into smaller tasks
claude "Just create the task queue system first"
```

### If Redis won't connect:
```bash
# Check Redis is running
redis-cli ping

# Restart if needed
brew services restart redis
```

### If tests fail:
```bash
# Run specific test with details
pytest tests/test_task_queue.py -vv

# Skip failing tests temporarily
pytest -k "not test_that_fails"
```

### If agents won't start:
```bash
# Check logs
tail -100 logs/agent-*.log

# Verify database
psql leanvibe_hive -c "SELECT * FROM agents;"

# Reset and retry
hive reset --confirm
hive agent create --type meta
```

## 📊 Validation Checklist

Before considering the system operational, verify:

- [ ] Bootstrap agent successfully creates other components
- [ ] Task queue processes tasks with correct priority
- [ ] Agents can send and receive messages
- [ ] Database stores and retrieves context
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Meta-Agent proposes valid improvements
- [ ] System runs for 1 hour without intervention
- [ ] At least one self-improvement is successfully applied
- [ ] Test coverage exceeds 90%
- [ ] All health checks pass

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know the system is working when:

1. **Agents collaborate without errors**
   - Tasks flow through the queue
   - Messages are exchanged
   - Context is shared

2. **Self-improvement is active**
   - New code is being generated
   - Tests are being written
   - Performance improves

3. **System is autonomous**
   - Runs overnight without crashes
   - Handles errors gracefully
   - Recovers from failures

## 🚀 Advanced Features to Enable

Once the basic system is running:

### Enable Sleep-Wake Cycles
```bash
hive config set sleep_schedule "02:00-04:00"
hive sleep-wake enable
```

### Add Specialized Agents
```bash
hive agent create --type architect --name "SystemArchitect"
hive agent create --type security --name "SecurityAuditor"
hive agent create --type performance --name "PerformanceOptimizer"
```

### Configure Observability
```bash
hive observability enable --prometheus --grafana
hive alerts add --type "task_failure_rate" --threshold 0.1
```

### Enable GitHub Integration
```bash
hive github connect --repo "your-org/leanvibe-hive"
hive github enable-prs --auto-review
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Let Claude Code see everything**: Place all .md files in the root directory so Claude can reference them

2. **Use the Meta-Agent**: Once running, submit improvement tasks rather than manual coding

3. **Trust the process**: The system will have bugs initially, but it will fix itself

4. **Monitor token usage**: Set up alerts for API costs
   ```bash
   hive config set max_tokens_per_hour 1000000
   ```

5. **Backup regularly**: The system modifies itself
   ```bash
   git commit -am "Checkpoint $(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
   ```

## 🎯 Final Goal

The ultimate success is when you can:

1. Submit a high-level task: "Build a REST API for user management"
2. The system automatically:
   - Plans the implementation
   - Assigns to appropriate agents
   - Writes the code
   - Creates tests
   - Deploys the feature
   - Documents everything
3. You review and approve the result

At this point, you have a true autonomous development system!

## 📞 Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs in `logs/` directory
2. Review agent outputs in `~/.claude/` 
3. Examine Redis queues: `redis-cli LLEN hive:queue:p5`
4. Verify database state: `psql leanvibe_hive`
5. Run diagnostics: `hive doctor`

Remember: This is a self-improving system. Many problems will be automatically detected and fixed by the Meta-Agent!
