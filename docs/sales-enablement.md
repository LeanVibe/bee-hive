## üìû Objection Handling

### "We're happy with our current development team"
**Response:** "That's great! LeanVibe isn't about replacing good developers - it's about making them 10x more productive. Use our agents for rapid prototyping, MVP development, or handling the routine work so your team can focus on complex business logic and innovation."

### "AI-generated code isn't production ready"
**Response:** "You're absolutely right about most AI tools. That's exactly why we built LeanVibe differently. Watch our demo and you'll see enterprise-grade code with comprehensive testing, security implementations, and deployment pipelines. This isn't ChatGPT code - this is production-ready software."

### "This seems too good to be true"
**Response:** "I understand the skepticism - this technology breakthrough just became possible. The key is our multi-agent orchestration. Instead of one AI doing everything poorly, we have five specialists doing their expertise exceptionally well. Would you like to see a live demo with your actual requirements?"

### "What about maintenance and updates?"
**Response:** "Great question. Our agents generate clean, well-documented, standards-compliant code that any developer can maintain. Plus, you can run the agents again to implement changes or add features. It's actually easier to maintain than traditional handwritten code."

### "How do I know this will work for my specific use case?"
**Response:** "Let's find out together. We offer pilot projects where we build a real component of your system. You can evaluate the code quality, test coverage, and production readiness with your own criteria. Most customers are convinced after seeing their actual requirements implemented."

### "What's the learning curve for my team?"
**Response:** "Minimal. The output is standard code using popular frameworks. Your team reviews and deploys exactly like any other project. The only difference is instead of spending weeks writing code, you spend minutes configuring agents and reviewing output."
