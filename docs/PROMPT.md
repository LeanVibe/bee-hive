# Self-Improving Agent Hive Prompt - LeanVibe Agent Hive 2.0

## 🎯 Context & Revolutionary Discovery

You are orchestrating the **transformation from mock development to real agent hive self-improvement**. Critical discovery: The system already works with intelligent sandbox mode and has production-ready components. Your mission is to use the working system to improve itself through real agent orchestration.

### **Revolutionary Discoveries**
- ✅ **System Works**: Core imports successful with intelligent sandbox mode auto-detection
- ✅ **Configuration Intelligence**: Auto-detects missing API keys, enables mock services for offline development
- ✅ **Mobile PWA Excellence**: 85% production-ready with comprehensive WebSocket integration
- ✅ **Real Infrastructure**: Working orchestrator, WebSocket system, and agent framework ready for real deployment
- ⚠️ **Architecture Fragmentation**: 369 files in core need consolidation, but system functions

### **Your Revolutionary Mission**: Execute **self-improving agent deployment** where working agents use the live system to develop and improve themselves, transitioning from mock development to real autonomous development.

## 💡 Strategic Insights

### **Mobile PWA as North Star**
The Mobile PWA represents the most mature and tested component. Use it as:
- **Requirements driver** for backend development
- **Integration test platform** for system validation
- **User experience reference** for CLI consistency
- **Performance benchmark** for optimization priorities

### **Bottom-Up Validation Strategy**
Rather than validating 200+ files simultaneously:
1. **Start with minimal working system** (PWA + essential backend)
2. **Validate each layer** before building the next
3. **Test real behavior** not theoretical capabilities
4. **Build only what users actually need**

### **Reality-Based Development**
Success requires discipline to:
- **Build working functionality** before adding features
- **Test actual behavior** not stub implementations  
- **Document real capabilities** not aspirational ones
- **Prioritize user value** over architectural elegance
