- Redis Performance: Message throughput and caching efficiency
```

### **2. Security Hardening & Authentication**

**Security Implementation:**
- **Authentication System**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Authorization Engine**: Fine-grained permissions for agents, tasks, and system operations
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security audit trail for enterprise compliance
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, request validation, and security headers
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit

**Contract Testing Integration:**
- Security contracts using established contract testing patterns
- Authentication flow validation with API integration tests
- Authorization testing using unit and integration test patterns

### **3. Monitoring & Observability Stack**

**Comprehensive Monitoring:**
- **Prometheus Integration**: Metrics collection from all system components
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Real-time visualization and alerting
- **Distributed Tracing**: Request flow tracking across components
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging with search and analysis
- **Health Checks**: Automated system health monitoring

**Testing Integration:**
- Monitor test execution and quality metrics
- Performance monitoring using testing pyramid benchmarks
- Alert configuration based on testing thresholds
