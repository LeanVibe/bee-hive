## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES: EPIC 5 IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Week 1-2: Import Resolution & Orchestrator Unification**

#### **Critical Import Issues to Resolve**
```python
# Current BROKEN imports across codebase:
from app.core.orchestrator import Orchestrator  # ‚Üê MODULE NOT FOUND
from app.core.simple_orchestrator import get_orchestrator  # ‚Üê CIRCULAR DEPS
from app.core.production_orchestrator import ProductionOrchestrator  # ‚Üê CONFLICTS
```

#### **Your First Tasks (DO IMMEDIATELY)**
1. **Create unified `app/core/orchestrator.py`**:
   ```python
   # Target: Single source of truth for orchestrator interface
   from typing import Protocol, Optional, Dict, Any
   import asyncio
   from datetime import datetime
   
   class OrchestratorProtocol(Protocol):
       async def register_agent(self, agent_spec: dict) -> str: ...
       async def delegate_task(self, task: dict) -> dict: ...
       async def get_agent_status(self, agent_id: str) -> dict: ...
       async def health_check(self) -> dict: ...
   
   class Orchestrator(OrchestratorProtocol):
       """Unified orchestrator interface combining all plugin capabilities"""
       def __init__(self, config: Optional[dict] = None):
           self.config = config or {}
           self.agents: Dict[str, Any] = {}
           self.plugins = []
           
       async def register_agent(self, agent_spec: dict) -> str:
           # Implementation combining simple_orchestrator + plugin system
           pass
   ```

2. **Fix `app/main.py` FastAPI startup**:
   ```python
   # BEFORE (BROKEN):
   from app.core.orchestrator import get_orchestrator  # FAILS
   
   # AFTER (WORKING):  
   from app.core.orchestrator import Orchestrator
   
   orchestrator = Orchestrator()
   
   @app.get("/health")
   async def health_check():
       try:
           status = await orchestrator.health_check()
           return {"status": "healthy", "orchestrator": status}
       except Exception as e:
           return {"status": "unhealthy", "error": str(e)}
   ```

3. **Validate system startup**:
   ```bash
   # Target: These must succeed
   python -c "from app.main import app; print('‚úÖ System operational')"
   curl http://localhost:18080/health  # Should return 200 OK
   ```

### **Week 2-3: API Gateway Stabilization**

#### **FastAPI Route Issues to Fix**
```python
# Current issue: Routes fail to register due to orchestrator import errors
# Fix dependency injection pattern:

from fastapi import Depends
from app.core.orchestrator import Orchestrator, get_orchestrator

async def get_orchestrator_dependency() -> Orchestrator:
    return get_orchestrator()

@app.get("/api/agents/")
async def list_agents(orchestrator: Orchestrator = Depends(get_orchestrator_dependency)):
    return await orchestrator.list_agents()
```

### **Week 3-4: Database Session Management**

#### **SQLAlchemy Session Lifecycle Issues**
```python
# Current problem: Async/sync conflicts and connection leaks
# Target implementation:

from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession, create_async_engine
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

@asynccontextmanager
async def get_session():
    async with AsyncSession(engine) as session:
        try:
            yield session
            await session.commit()
        except Exception:
            await session.rollback()
            raise
        finally:
            await session.close()
```

## üß™ **TESTING STRATEGY (Epic 6)**

### **Test Infrastructure Consolidation Required**
- **Current**: 189 test files with 45% pass rate
- **Target**: 200 tests with >90% pass rate in 5 minutes

#### **Create Unified Test Foundation**
```python
# tests/conftest.py - Create this foundation
import pytest
import asyncio
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine
from app.core.orchestrator import Orchestrator

@pytest.fixture
async def test_orchestrator():
    """Isolated orchestrator for testing"""
    config = {"test_mode": True, "max_agents": 5}
    orchestrator = Orchestrator(config)
    yield orchestrator
    await orchestrator.cleanup()

@pytest.fixture 
async def test_database():
    """In-memory SQLite for testing"""
    engine = create_async_engine("sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:")
    # Create tables, yield session, cleanup
```

---

## üì± **MOBILE DASHBOARD INTEGRATION (Epic 7)**

### **PWA Connection Requirements**
The mobile dashboard exists at `pwa/` but cannot connect:

```typescript
// Current issue: API endpoints not accessible
// Target: Reliable WebSocket + REST API integration

const API_BASE = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:18080';

export class AgentHiveAPI {
  private ws: WebSocket | null = null;
  
  async connect(): Promise<boolean> {
    try {
      // Test health endpoint first
      const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/health`);
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error('API unhealthy');
      
      // Initialize WebSocket for real-time updates
      this.ws = new WebSocket(`${API_BASE.replace('http', 'ws')}/ws`);
      return true;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Connection failed:', error);
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY**

### **First Principles Approach - MANDATORY**
1. **Start with what users need**: Working system over sophisticated features
2. **Question every assumption**: Does this actually solve a user problem?
3. **Build from fundamentals**: Imports ‚Üí Health checks ‚Üí Basic functionality
4. **Measure actual impact**: User can complete a task vs. theoretical capabilities

### **Pragmatic Engineering Standards**
```python
# Test-Driven Development - NON-NEGOTIABLE
def test_orchestrator_starts_without_errors():
    """Write this test FIRST, then make it pass"""
    orchestrator = Orchestrator()
    status = orchestrator.health_check()
    assert status["status"] == "healthy"

# THEN implement:
class Orchestrator:
    def health_check(self):
        return {"status": "healthy", "agents": len(self.agents)}
```

### **Quality Gates - ENFORCE STRICTLY**
```bash
# Before committing ANY change:
python -c "from app.main import app; print('‚úÖ Imports work')"  # MUST PASS
python -m pytest tests/test_basic_functionality.py  # MUST PASS
curl http://localhost:18080/health  # MUST return 200
```

---

## üìã **AGENT COORDINATION STRATEGY**

### **When to Deploy Specialized Agents**
- **Backend Engineer**: For complex orchestrator refactoring (Epic 5 Week 1)
- **QA Test Guardian**: For test infrastructure rebuild (Epic 6)
- **DevOps Deployer**: For production deployment setup (Epic 7)
- **Frontend Builder**: For PWA-API integration (Epic 7)

### **Agent Deployment Pattern**
```python
# Use this pattern for complex tasks:
from claude_code import Task

await Task(
    subagent_type="backend-engineer",
    description="Fix orchestrator import resolution",
    prompt="""
    Critical Mission: Resolve 25+ broken imports preventing system startup.
    
    Context: System has sophisticated plugins but basic imports fail.
    
    Requirements:
    1. Create unified app/core/orchestrator.py interface
    2. Consolidate simple_orchestrator.py and production_orchestrator.py
    3. Fix circular dependencies in plugin loading
    4. Validate with: python -c "from app.main import app"
    
    Success Criteria: Zero import errors, system starts successfully.
    """
)
```

## üéØ **SUCCESS VALIDATION CHECKLIST**

### **Epic 5 Completion Criteria - MANDATORY**
- [ ] `python -c "from app.main import app; print('‚úÖ Operational')"` succeeds
- [ ] `curl http://localhost:18080/health` returns 200 OK
- [ ] All CLI commands execute without import errors
- [ ] FastAPI docs accessible at `/docs` endpoint
- [ ] WebSocket connections can be established

### **Business Value Validation**
```python
# User Journey Test - MUST WORK:
async def test_basic_user_journey():
    """Complete user workflow from start to finish"""
    # 1. System starts
    from app.main import app
    
    # 2. Health check passes
    response = await client.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    
    # 3. Agent can be registered
    agent_response = await client.post("/api/agents/", json={
        "name": "test-agent",
        "type": "backend-engineer"
    })
    assert agent_response.status_code == 201
    
    # 4. Agent status can be retrieved
    agent_id = agent_response.json()["id"] 
    status_response = await client.get(f"/api/agents/{agent_id}")
    assert status_response.status_code == 200
```
