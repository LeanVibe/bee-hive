#### **Implementation Approach (TDD Required)**
```typescript  
// 1. Interactive Onboarding System (Week 1)
describe('Interactive Onboarding', () => {
  test('should complete onboarding with 90%+ success rate', async () => {
    const onboarding = new InteractiveOnboarding();
    const result = await onboarding.completeUserJourney();
    expect(result.completionRate).toBeGreaterThan(0.9);
    expect(result.timeToValue).toBeLessThan(300); // 5 minutes
  });
});

// 2. Advanced RBAC System (Week 2)
describe('Advanced RBAC', () => {
  test('should enforce role-based permissions correctly', async () => {
    const rbac = new AdvancedRBAC();
    const userPermissions = await rbac.getUserPermissions('admin-user');
    expect(userPermissions).toContain('agent:create');
    expect(userPermissions).toContain('dashboard:access');
  });
});

// 3. Contextual Help System (Week 3)
describe('Contextual Help', () => {
  test('should reduce support tickets by 50%', async () => {
    const helpSystem = new ContextualHelp();
    const helpMetrics = await helpSystem.getHelpUsageMetrics();
    expect(helpMetrics.supportTicketReduction).toBeGreaterThan(0.5);
    expect(helpMetrics.userSelfServiceRate).toBeGreaterThan(0.8);
  });
});
```

#### **Success Criteria (Non-Negotiable)**
- **Interactive Onboarding**: 90%+ completion rate with <5 minute time-to-value
- **Advanced RBAC**: Enterprise-grade user management with audit trails
- **Contextual Help**: 50% reduction in support tickets through intelligent assistance  
- **User Engagement**: 40% increase in daily active users through personalization

## 🛠️ **IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY**

### **Pragmatic Engineering Approach**
Apply these principles religiously:

#### **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)**
- Focus on features that deliver 80% of user value with 20% of effort
- When in doubt: "Does this directly serve our core user journey?"
- Prioritize business impact over technical elegance

#### **Test-Driven Development (Non-Negotiable)**
```python
# Mandatory TDD Workflow:
def implement_any_feature():
    # 1. Write failing test defining expected behavior
    def test_feature_behavior():
        result = feature.execute(input_data)
        assert result == expected_output
    
    # 2. Implement minimal code to pass test
    def feature.execute(input_data):
        return minimal_implementation()
    
    # 3. Refactor while keeping tests green
    def refactor_and_optimize():
        return production_ready_implementation()
```

#### **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**
- Build only what's immediately required for user value
- Avoid over-engineering and speculative features
- Simple solutions beat clever solutions

#### **Clean Architecture Patterns**
- Separate concerns: data, domain, presentation layers
- Dependency injection for maximum testability  
- Clear interfaces between all components
