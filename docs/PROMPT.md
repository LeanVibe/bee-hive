## 🛠️ **IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY**

### **Pragmatic Engineering Approach**
Apply these principles religiously:

#### **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)**
- Focus on features that deliver 80% of user value with 20% of effort
- When in doubt: "Does this directly serve our core user journey?"
- Prioritize business impact over technical elegance

#### **Test-Driven Development (Non-Negotiable)**
```python
# Mandatory TDD Workflow:
def implement_any_feature():
    # 1. Write failing test defining expected behavior
    def test_feature_behavior():
        result = feature.execute(input_data)
        assert result == expected_output
    
    # 2. Implement minimal code to pass test
    def feature.execute(input_data):
        return minimal_implementation()
    
    # 3. Refactor while keeping tests green
    def refactor_and_optimize():
        return production_ready_implementation()
```

#### **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**
- Build only what's immediately required for user value
- Avoid over-engineering and speculative features
- Simple solutions beat clever solutions

#### **Clean Architecture Patterns**
- Separate concerns: data, domain, presentation layers
- Dependency injection for maximum testability  
- Clear interfaces between all components
