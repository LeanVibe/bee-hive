        self.target_uptime = 0.999  # 99.9%
        self.downtime_threshold = timedelta(minutes=43.8)  # Max monthly downtime
    
    async def validate_sla_compliance(self, period: timedelta = timedelta(days=30)) -> Dict:
        """Validate SLA compliance over specified period"""
        end_time = datetime.now()
        start_time = end_time - period
        
        downtime_incidents = await self.get_downtime_incidents(start_time, end_time)
        total_downtime = sum(incident.duration for incident in downtime_incidents)
        
        uptime_percentage = 1 - (total_downtime.total_seconds() / period.total_seconds())
        
        return {
