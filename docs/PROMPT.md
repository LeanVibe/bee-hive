## 🛠️ **IMMEDIATE FIRST 4 HOURS EXECUTION**

### **Step 1: Validate Current System State (60 minutes)**

```bash
# Confirm infrastructure is operational (should work post-recovery)
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/status

# Validate CLI current state
python -m app.cli --help
python -m app.cli get agents  # Should fail - no API endpoint

# Test SimpleOrchestrator directly
python -c "from app.core.simple_orchestrator import create_simple_orchestrator; o=create_simple_orchestrator(); print(o)"
```

### **Step 2: Identify Missing API Endpoints (90 minutes)**

```bash
# Check current API endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/docs  # See what endpoints exist
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents  # Should return 404

# Examine existing API structure
ls -la app/api/
grep -r "agents" app/api/  # Find any existing agent endpoints

# Test SimpleOrchestrator methods that need API exposure
python -c "
from app.core.simple_orchestrator import create_simple_orchestrator
orchestrator = create_simple_orchestrator()
print(dir(orchestrator))  # List available methods
"
```

### **Step 3: Create Epic 1 Phase 1.1 Implementation Plan (60 minutes)**

```bash
# Create the missing API endpoint file
touch app/api/v1/agents.py

# Create schemas for request/response
touch app/schemas/agent.py

# Plan the integration points
echo "# Epic 1 Phase 1.1 TODO:
1. Create AgentCreateRequest and AgentResponse schemas
2. Implement POST /api/v1/agents → SimpleOrchestrator.create_agent()
3. Implement GET /api/v1/agents → SimpleOrchestrator.list_agents()
4. Test CLI integration with new endpoints
5. Validate agent lifecycle works end-to-end
" > epic1_phase1_plan.md
```

### **Step 4: Begin Implementation (Start Epic 1)**
