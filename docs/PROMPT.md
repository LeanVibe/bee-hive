# LeanVibe Agent Hive 2.0 - Next Agent Handoff Prompt

## üéØ Context & Mission

You are taking over the **LeanVibe Agent Hive 2.0** project after comprehensive system audit and consolidation strategy development. The system has been thoroughly analyzed revealing **68% overall maturity** with strong working components requiring targeted integration work.

### **Critical Discovery**: 68% Functional System + Enhanced Human-Friendly IDs + Strategic Consolidation Plan
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Human-Friendly ID System**: `dev-01`, `qa-02`, `login-fix-01` working perfectly
- ‚úÖ **Mobile PWA**: 85% production-ready with comprehensive testing and WebSocket integration  
- ‚úÖ **Working SimpleOrchestrator**: Can spawn and manage agents autonomously
- ‚úÖ **Command Ecosystem**: 850+ lines ready but blocked by dependency issues
- ‚úÖ **CLI Infrastructure**: 80% complete with multiple entry points needing unification
- ‚ùå **Critical Integration Issues**: API-PWA runtime connection, missing dependencies blocking imports
- üéØ **Mission**: Execute 4-week Foundation Consolidation to achieve >95% integration success before Epic execution

## üîç **ANT-FARM REPOSITORY KEY INSIGHTS**

### **Critical Patterns to Adopt**
1. **Centralized `hive` Command**: Single entry point with subcommands (`hive agent spawn`, `hive task submit`)
2. **Typer Framework**: Rich CLI with autocomplete, help, and error handling
3. **Short ID System**: Semantic naming (`meta_agent.py`, `cmd_{timestamp}`)
4. **Redis Task Queue**: Distributed agent coordination with priority
5. **6-Phase Development**: Structured autonomous development workflow
6. **Emergency Intervention**: 5-level safety system for agent management
7. **Multi-CLI Support**: Auto-detection (opencode ‚Üí claude ‚Üí gemini ‚Üí API)

### **Agent Specialization Framework**
- **Meta-Agent**: System coordination and architecture analysis
- **Backend-Developer**: API implementation and data services
- **QA-Engineer**: Testing, validation, quality assurance
- **DevOps-Engineer**: Infrastructure, deployment, operations
- **Frontend-Developer**: PWA optimization and mobile interfaces

## üìã **CURRENT PROJECT STATE - COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT RESULTS**

### **What Actually Works (Validated) - 68% Overall System Maturity**
- **Enhanced Human-Friendly IDs**: `/app/core/human_friendly_id_system.py` + `/app/enhanced_hive_cli.py` - Working perfectly with dev-01, qa-02, login-fix-01 patterns
- **SimpleOrchestrator**: `/app/core/simple_orchestrator.py` - Agent spawning and management (75% mature)
- **Mobile PWA**: `/mobile-pwa/` - **85% production-ready** with TypeScript, WebSocket, Playwright tests (strongest component)
- **CLI Infrastructure**: `/app/cli/` + `/app/hive_cli.py` + `/app/enhanced_hive_cli.py` - 80% complete, multiple entry points
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL + pgvector + SQLAlchemy models (72% mature) 
- **WebSocket Infrastructure**: Real-time communication functional (70% mature)

### **Critical Integration Issues (Immediate Blockers)**
- **Command Ecosystem Import Failures**: Missing dependencies (tiktoken, langchain) blocking 850+ lines of integration code
- **API-PWA Runtime Connection**: Backend not connecting to PWA despite functional components (60% mature)
- **Multiple CLI Entry Points**: Need unification into single `hive` command with backward compatibility
- **Security Integration**: Multiple frameworks present but not connected (49% mature)
- **Documentation-Reality Misalignment**: Some docs claim 100% completion for partial implementations

### **Architecture Reality**
- **Strong Foundation**: Working components need integration, not rebuilding
- **Consolidation Priority**: Bottom-up testing and integration approach required
- **Foundation Strength**: Mobile PWA + Enhanced Human-Friendly IDs + SimpleOrchestrator = solid base

## üéØ **YOUR IMMEDIATE MISSION: FOUNDATION CONSOLIDATION**

### **Foundation Consolidation** (Weeks 1-4) - **CRITICAL PRIORITY**

## ü§ñ **SUBAGENT DELEGATION STRATEGY**

### **When to Use Subagents**
- **Complex multi-step tasks** requiring 3+ distinct operations
- **Specialized domain expertise** (CLI, mobile, backend, testing)
- **Parallel development** where multiple components need simultaneous work
- **Quality assurance** requiring dedicated testing and validation

### **How to Delegate**
1. **Create specific subagent roles** based on ant-farm patterns
2. **Define clear deliverables** and success metrics
3. **Establish communication protocols** via Redis/WebSocket
4. **Monitor progress** through PWA dashboard
5. **Coordinate integration** through Meta-Agent oversight

### **Subagent Templates**
```python
# Meta-Agent for system coordination
meta_agent = orchestrator.create_agent(
    role="Meta-Agent",
    task="Analyze system architecture and coordinate Epic 1 implementation",
    specialization="system_analysis",
    tools=["code_analysis", "dependency_resolution", "performance_optimization"]
)

# Backend-Developer for API implementation  
backend_agent = orchestrator.create_agent(
    role="Backend-Developer",
    task="Implement PWA-required backend APIs",
    specialization="fastapi_development", 
    tools=["database_design", "websocket_implementation", "api_development"]
)

# QA-Engineer for testing and validation
qa_agent = orchestrator.create_agent(
    role="QA-Engineer", 
    task="Create comprehensive test suites for Epic 1 deliverables",
    specialization="test_automation",
    tools=["contract_testing", "performance_testing", "quality_gates"]
)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL PRINCIPLES & ANTI-PATTERNS**

### **Development Principles**
- **Working Over Perfect**: Focus on functionality before optimization
- **Ant-Farm Patterns First**: Use proven patterns from ant-farm analysis
- **Mobile PWA as Driver**: Use strongest component to drive requirements
- **Real Agents Over Mocks**: Deploy actual agents for self-improvement
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build incrementally, validate each layer

### **Anti-Patterns to Avoid**
- **Documentation Inflation**: Don't claim completion without working implementation
- **Architecture Astronautics**: Avoid over-engineering and excessive abstraction  
- **Stub Programming**: Don't implement placeholder code and claim it's functional
- **Context Rot**: Use subagents to prevent overwhelming single session

### **Quality Standards**
- **Test What Works**: Validate actual behavior, not theoretical behavior
- **Commit After Validation**: Only commit after tests pass and build succeeds
- **Real User Workflows**: Ensure actual users can accomplish real tasks
- **Performance Reality**: Measure actual performance, not theoretical claims

- **Update todo lists** to track progress across sessions
- **Maintain strategic focus** on Epic 1 objectives
- **Escalate blockers** quickly to maintain momentum

### **Communication Protocols**
- **Update PLAN.md** with significant progress or changes
- **Keep PROMPT.md current** for future agent handoffs
- **Use structured logging** for agent coordination
- **Real-time updates** via PWA dashboard

## üí° **STRATEGIC INSIGHTS**

### **Key Success Factors**
1. **Leverage Working Foundation**: Build on SimpleOrchestrator + PWA + Command Ecosystem
2. **Apply Proven Patterns**: Use ant-farm CLI architecture and agent patterns
3. **Progressive Implementation**: Validate each component before building next layer
4. **Real Agent Coordination**: Deploy actual agents for self-improvement
5. **Mobile-First Integration**: Use PWA as primary interface for agent management

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Avoid Context Rot**: Use subagents for complex multi-step tasks
- **Prevent Regression**: Comprehensive testing before any changes
- **Maintain Focus**: Epic 1 completion is prerequisite for Epic 2
- **Quality First**: Working implementation over architectural elegance

### **Long-Term Vision**
With Epic 1 complete, the system will have:
- **Unified CLI** following proven ant-farm patterns
- **Short ID system** for easy entity reference
- **Enhanced command discovery** with AI assistance
- **Foundation for real agent deployment** in Epic 2
- **Mobile PWA integration** for agent management

## üéØ **YOUR SUCCESS MISSION**

**Transform LeanVibe Agent Hive 2.0 from a 68% functional system with integration challenges to a production-ready autonomous development platform.**

**Execute Foundation Consolidation** to achieve >95% integration success, establishing a unified foundation that will enable real agent deployment and self-improving development in subsequent epics.

**Use bottom-up consolidation approach** with proven ant-farm patterns to create a robust, scalable system that can develop itself autonomously.

**Success Metric**: By end of Foundation Consolidation, `hive2 agent spawn backend-developer` should successfully deploy a real agent that can analyze PWA requirements and begin implementing backend APIs autonomously, with all components integrated and tested.
