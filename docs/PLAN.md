# Option 1: Local PostgreSQL
brew services start postgresql
psql -c "CREATE DATABASE leanvibe_dev;" -U postgres

# Option 2: Docker PostgreSQL 
docker run -d --name postgres-leanvibe \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=leanvibe_dev \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=leanvive \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dev \
  -p 15432:5432 postgres:15
```

**Priority 2: Security System Async Fix**
```python

# - Redis server operational (port 16379) with <5ms response time  
# - FastAPI application importing successfully (339 routes available)
# - Core systems initialized (Strategic Analytics, Performance Monitoring)
```

#### **🚑 IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Critical Infrastructure Gaps (Days 2-3)**
```bash
# CRITICAL BLOCKER 1: Database Connectivity Recovery
cd /Users/bogdan/work/leanvibe-dev/bee-hive

# Option 1: Start local PostgreSQL service
brew services start postgresql
psql -c "CREATE DATABASE leanvibe_dev;" -U postgres

# Option 2: Docker PostgreSQL for development
docker run -d --name postgres-leanvibe \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=leanvibe_dev \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=leanvibe \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dev \
  -p 15432:5432 postgres:15

# Validate database connectivity
python3 -c "

}

# Success validation:
# All endpoints should return 2xx status (not 400)
# curl http://localhost:8000/health should return {"status": "healthy"}
# curl http://localhost:8000/docs should return Swagger UI
```
