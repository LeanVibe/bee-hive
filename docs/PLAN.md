   # - production_orchestrator.py  
   # - vertical_slice_orchestrator.py
   
   # Create capability mapping matrix
   python analyze_legacy_capabilities.py --generate-matrix
   ```

2. **Facade Pattern Implementation** (Days 2-3)
   ```python
   class LegacyCompatibilityPlugin:
       """Facade maintaining existing interfaces while using OrchestratorV2"""
       
       def __init__(self, orchestrator_v2):
           self.v2 = orchestrator_v2
           self.legacy_interface_map = self._build_interface_map()
       
       # Maintain exact API compatibility for existing callers
       def legacy_method(self, *args, **kwargs):
           return self.v2.modern_equivalent(*args, **kwargs)
   ```

3. **Incremental Migration** (Days 4-5)
   - **Phase 3.1A**: Map legacy interfaces to OrchestratorV2 capabilities
   - **Phase 3.1B**: Implement compatibility shims for breaking changes
