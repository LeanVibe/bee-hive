## Epic 1: Core System Consolidation üèóÔ∏è
**Priority: CRITICAL | Timeline: 3 weeks | Impact: Foundation for all future work**

### Problem Statement
The system suffers from orchestrator proliferation (25 files) and manager class explosion (348 core files). This creates:
- Development velocity bottlenecks
- Bug surface area explosion  
- Resource utilization inefficiency
- Maintenance nightmare

### Solution Architecture

#### Phase 1.1: Orchestrator Consolidation (Week 1)
**Target: 25 orchestrators ‚Üí 3 unified patterns**

**Keep (3 Core Orchestrators):**
```
app/core/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestrator.py              # Production orchestrator (unified)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ development_orchestrator.py  # Development/testing variant  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestrator_plugins/        # Plugin architecture
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ performance_plugin.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ security_plugin.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ context_plugin.py
```

**Remove (22 Redundant Files):**
- `enhanced_orchestrator_integration.py`
- `production_orchestrator.py` 
- `orchestrator_migration_adapter.py`
- All specialized orchestrators (CLI, container, automated)
- Testing/demo orchestrator variants
- Legacy orchestrator implementations

**Technical Approach:**
1. Merge functionality from all 25 files into `orchestrator.py`
2. Extract specialized logic into plugin architecture
3. Implement backward compatibility layer during transition
4. Migrate all import statements across codebase

#### Phase 1.2: Manager Class Unification (Week 2)
**Target: 348 core files ‚Üí 70 focused modules**

**Unified Manager Architecture:**
```
app/core/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent_manager.py           # Agent lifecycle, spawning, monitoring
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflow_manager.py        # Task distribution, execution flows
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resource_manager.py        # Memory, compute, storage allocation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ communication_manager.py   # WebSocket, Redis, inter-agent messaging
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ security_manager.py        # Authentication, authorization, audit
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ storage_manager.py         # Database, cache, persistent state
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ context_manager.py         # Session state, context compression
```

**Consolidation Mapping:**
- **Agent Domain**: Merge 15 agent-related files ‚Üí `agent_manager.py`
- **Context Domain**: Merge 18 context files ‚Üí `context_manager.py`  
- **Performance Domain**: Merge 35 files ‚Üí `resource_manager.py` + plugins
- **Communication**: Merge 24 files ‚Üí `communication_manager.py`
- **Security**: Merge 41 files ‚Üí `security_manager.py` + enterprise plugins

#### Phase 1.3: Configuration Unification (Week 3)
**Target: Single configuration pattern across system**

**Unified Config Structure:**
```python
# app/core/config.py - Single source of truth
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # Core system settings
    orchestrator: OrchestratorConfig
    managers: ManagersConfig  
    api: APIConfig
    database: DatabaseConfig
    redis: RedisConfig
    
    # Plugin configurations
    plugins: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 80% reduction in core file count (348 ‚Üí 70 files)
- [ ] 88% reduction in orchestrator files (25 ‚Üí 3 files)  
- [ ] All existing tests pass after consolidation
- [ ] 50% faster application startup time
- [ ] Single configuration entry point

- Multiple authentication schemes
- Overlapping functionality across v1/, dashboard_, enterprise_ patterns
- Inconsistent error handling and response formats
- WebSocket contract violations

### Solution Architecture

#### Phase 2.1: API Endpoint Consolidation (Week 1)
**Target: 50+ API modules ‚Üí 15 resource-based endpoints**

**RESTful Resource Architecture:**
```
app/api/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents.py          # Agent CRUD, lifecycle operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows.py       # Workflow management, execution
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.py           # Task distribution, monitoring
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects.py        # Project indexing, analysis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ coordination.py    # Multi-agent coordination
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ observability.py   # Metrics, logging, health
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ security.py        # Auth, permissions, audit
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources.py       # System resources, allocation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contexts.py        # Context management, compression
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ enterprise.py      # Enterprise-specific features
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ websocket.py       # WebSocket coordination
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ health.py          # System health, diagnostics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ admin.py           # Administrative operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integrations.py    # External service integrations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard.py       # Dashboard-specific endpoints
```

**Remove/Consolidate:**
- All v1/ versioned endpoints ‚Üí direct resource endpoints
- Duplicate dashboard/enterprise/monitoring endpoints
- Legacy route implementations
- Redundant authentication middleware

#### Phase 2.2: WebSocket Contract Enforcement (Week 2)
**Target: 100% contract compliance with version guarantees**

**Contract-First Architecture:**
```typescript
// WebSocket Contract (shared between frontend/backend)
interface WSContract {
  version: "2.0";
  events: {
    agent_status: AgentStatusEvent;
    task_update: TaskUpdateEvent;
    coordination: CoordinationEvent;
    error: ErrorEvent;
  };
  commands: {
    spawn_agent: SpawnAgentCommand;
    execute_task: ExecuteTaskCommand;
    coordinate: CoordinateCommand;
  };
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Contract validation middleware
- Automatic contract testing
- Version negotiation support
- Client SDK generation

### Success Criteria
