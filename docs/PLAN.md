*Focus: Self-Improving Agent System with Ant-Farm CLI Patterns*

## üîç **ANT-FARM REPOSITORY ANALYSIS - KEY INSIGHTS**

### **CLI Command Patterns Discovered**
**From ant-farm repository analysis:**

#### **Centralized Command Architecture**
- **Single `hive` command** with subcommands: `hive agent tools`, `hive init`, `hive task submit`
- **Typer framework** for CLI with rich help and autocomplete
- **Modular command groups** dynamically loaded (system, agent, task, context, project)
- **Graceful error handling** with user-friendly console output

#### **Task Management Patterns**
- **Redis-based task queue** with priority distribution
- **6-phase development roadmap** with defined session phases
- **Agent specialization**: Meta-Agent, Developer, QA, Architect, DevOps
- **Emergency intervention system** with 5 safety levels

#### **ID Systems & Naming Conventions**
- **Semantic, descriptive naming**: `meta_agent.py`, `session_manager.py`
- **Hyphen-underscore separation**: consistent patterns
- **Type indicators in filenames**: explicit functionality identification
- **Execution IDs**: `cmd_{timestamp}` for traceability

#### **Agent Integration Patterns**
- **Multi-agent coordination** with unified base agent
- **Base agent with multi-CLI support**: flexible tool integration
- **Intelligent task assignment** based on agent capabilities
- **Message broker** for inter-agent communication

#### **Configuration & Context Management**
- **Auto-detection of CLI tools**: opencode ‚Üí claude ‚Üí gemini ‚Üí API fallback
- **Environment variable forcing**: specific tool selection
- **Flexible context handling** across different tools
- **Sandbox mode intelligence**: auto-enables when API keys missing
