- ‚úÖ **Database Persistence**: Full agent and task data persistence with error handling
- ‚úÖ **Orchestrator Integration**: API v2 endpoints use WebSocket-enabled SimpleOrchestrator

**‚ùå REMAINING CRITICAL GAPS:**
- **Testing Infrastructure Blocked**: pytest configuration issues prevent validation of implementation claims
- **Performance Claims Unvalidated**: "39,092x improvement" needs measurement evidence for enterprise sales
- **PWA-Backend Integration**: Mobile app connection testing and end-to-end validation needed
- **Production Security & Monitoring**: Enterprise-grade features required for customer deployments

**System Status**: **Core functionality operational - ready for quality validation and enterprise features**

---

## üöÄ **FIRST PRINCIPLES STRATEGIC APPROACH**

### **Fundamental Truth #1: Working PWA Defines Success**
The 85% complete Mobile PWA is our **primary business value delivery mechanism**. All backend development must serve PWA requirements to create demonstrable multi-agent orchestration for customers.

### **Fundamental Truth #2: Evidence-Based Capabilities**
We will only claim capabilities we can demonstrate end-to-end. Architecture without working functionality provides zero market value.

### **Fundamental Truth #3: Business Value First**  
60% of effort goes to making documented features actually work, 30% to quality assurance, 10% to new features only if they serve immediate business needs.

### **Fundamental Truth #4: Customer-Driven Development**
The working PWA interface serves as our specification. Backend APIs must fulfill PWA requirements for complete user journeys.
