# LeanVibe Agent Hive 2.0 - Strategic Implementation Plan
**First Principles Analysis & 4-Epic Roadmap**

## üéØ Executive Summary

After comprehensive codebase evaluation, we've identified a critical gap between **documented completeness (97.4%)** and **actual functionality (non-functional)**. The system requires fundamental stabilization before advanced features can deliver value.

**Core Finding**: Over-engineering has created complexity without working core functionality. We must pivot from "feature completeness" to "working system" using first principles approach.

## üìä Current State Reality Check

### What's Actually Working ‚úÖ
- **Documentation**: Exceptional coverage and quality
- **Architecture Design**: Solid patterns and interfaces
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test infrastructure 
- **PWA Dashboard**: Modern frontend with Lit + TypeScript
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based settings

### Critical Blockers ‚ùå
- **Import Errors**: System cannot start due to missing dependencies
- **Over-Engineering**: 3,891-line orchestrator file indicating bloat
- **Non-Functional Core**: Agent coordination doesn't work despite documentation
- **Database Issues**: Schema and migration problems
- **Integration Failures**: Components don't connect properly
