## 📊 **IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY**

### **Test-Driven Development Protocol**
```python
# Mandatory TDD Workflow:
def implement_feature(feature_spec):
    # 1. Write failing test first
    def test_feature_behavior():
        result = feature.execute(input_data)
        assert result == expected_output
    
    # 2. Implement minimal code to pass
    def feature.execute(input_data):
        return minimal_implementation()
    
    # 3. Refactor while keeping tests green
    def feature.execute(input_data):
        return optimized_implementation()
```

### **Component Isolation Strategy**
```python
# Test isolation patterns:
@pytest.fixture
def isolated_database():
    """In-memory SQLite for tests"""
    engine = create_engine("sqlite:///:memory:")
    # Setup schema, yield session, cleanup

@pytest.fixture  
def mock_orchestrator():
    """Mock orchestrator with predictable behavior"""
    orchestrator = Mock(spec=Orchestrator)
    orchestrator.register_agent.return_value = "test-agent-id"
    return orchestrator

@pytest.fixture
def test_api_client():
    """Test client with isolated dependencies"""
    app = create_app(test_config)
    return TestClient(app)
```

### **Quality Gates Enforcement**
```bash
# Pre-commit validation (mandatory):
python -m pytest --tb=short -x          # All tests pass
python -m mypy app/ --strict            # Type checking passes  
python -m black app/ tests/ --check     # Code formatting consistent
python -m isort app/ tests/ --check-only # Import sorting consistent
python -c "from app.main import app"    # Main app imports successfully
