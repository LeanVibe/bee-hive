# ü§ñ Autonomous Development Guide - LeanVibe Agent Hive 2.0

**Transform from AI-assisted coding to fully autonomous development**

## üöÄ Quick Start

See the canonical `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` for end-to-end setup. Once running, try:

```bash
python3 scripts/demos/user_success_journey_15min.py
```

## üéØ What Is Autonomous Development?

**Traditional AI Tools:** "Here's a suggestion for the next line"  
**LeanVibe Agent Hive:** "I have completed the API. Tests are passing, docs are ready."

### Key Paradigm Shifts

| Aspect | Traditional AI Tools | LeanVibe Autonomous |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Scope** | Micro-tasks (lines, functions) | Macro-tasks (features, projects) |
| **Role** | Pair programmer/Assistant | Autonomous development team |
| **User Role** | Coder/Typist | Architect/Technical lead |
| **Interaction** | Session-based suggestions | Goal delegation & review |
| **Value Prop** | "Code faster" | "Ship features faster" |
