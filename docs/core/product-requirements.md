## Executive Summary

**Product**: LeanVibe Agent Hive 2.0 - Autonomous Multi-Agent Development System
**Version**: 2.0.0 (Complete Rewrite)
**Target Launch**: Q2 2025
**Team**: Solo Founder + AI Agents (Self-Developing System)

### Key Value Proposition
A self-improving, autonomous multi-agent system that enables solo developers to build and maintain complex software projects using Claude AI instances working collaboratively in specialized roles, operating 24/7 with minimal human intervention.

### Success Criteria
- **Primary**: System successfully develops itself (meta-development capability)
- **Secondary**: 80% reduction in manual development time
- **Tertiary**: 24/7 autonomous operation with >95% uptime

## Problem Statement

### Current State Analysis
Based on the original LeanVibe Agent Hive implementation, several critical limitations exist:

1. **Communication Reliability**: Basic inter-agent communication without guaranteed delivery
2. **Context Preservation**: Limited memory management leading to context loss
3. **Observability Gaps**: Insufficient monitoring and debugging capabilities
4. **Sleep-Wake Architecture**: Rudimentary session persistence without intelligent consolidation
5. **Self-Improvement**: No systematic approach to prompt optimization and system evolution

### Market Opportunity
- Growing demand for autonomous development tools
- Solo entrepreneur market expansion (43% YoY growth)
- AI agent orchestration market projected $8B by 2030
- Competitive advantage through self-developing systems

## Solution Overview

### Core Innovation: Self-Developing Architecture
Unlike traditional development tools, LeanVibe Agent Hive 2.0 will use Claude instances to develop and improve itself, creating a feedback loop of continuous enhancement.
