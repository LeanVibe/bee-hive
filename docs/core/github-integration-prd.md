# PRD: GitHub Integration & Version Control
**Priority**: Must-Have (Phase 1) | **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks | **Technical Complexity**: Medium

## Executive Summary
A comprehensive GitHub integration system that enables agents to manage repositories, create pull requests, handle issues, and maintain version control workflows. The system supports multiple work trees, branch management, and automated code review processes while maintaining security and audit trails[41][49][53].

## Problem Statement
Agents need seamless integration with GitHub to participate in software development workflows, but current limitations include:
- No standardized way for agents to interact with GitHub repositories
- Lack of proper branch management and work tree isolation
- No automated pull request creation and review processes
- Missing integration with CI/CD pipelines
- No tracking of agent contributions and code changes
- Insufficient security controls for repository access

## Success Metrics
- **GitHub API success rate**: >99.5%
- **Pull request creation time**: <30 seconds
- **Branch merge success rate**: >95%
- **Work tree isolation effectiveness**: 100% (no cross-contamination)
- **Code review automation coverage**: >80% of standard checks
- **Agent contribution tracking**: 100% of agent commits properly attributed

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components
1. **GitHub API Client** - Authenticated interaction with GitHub REST/GraphQL APIs
2. **Branch Manager** - Automated branch creation and management
3. **Work Tree Handler** - Isolated development environments per agent
4. **Pull Request Automator** - Automated PR creation, review, and management
5. **Issue Tracker Integration** - Bi-directional issue management
6. **Code Review Assistant** - Automated code analysis and review comments

## User Stories & Acceptance Tests

### Story 1: Repository Setup and Work Tree Management
**As an** AI agent  
**I want** to set up isolated work trees for different repositories  
**So that** I can work on multiple projects without interference

**Acceptance Tests:**
```python
def test_repository_setup():
    # Given a GitHub repository URL
    repo_url = "https://github.com/myorg/myproject"
    agent_id = "dev-agent-001"
    
    # When setting up repository access
    response = github_integration.setup_repository(
        repository_url=repo_url,
        agent_id=agent_id,
        permissions=["read", "write", "issues", "pull_requests"]
    )
    
    # Then work tree is created successfully
    assert response.status_code == 200
    work_tree_info = response.json()
    
    assert work_tree_info["work_tree_path"].endswith(f"/{agent_id}/myproject")
    assert work_tree_info["branch_name"].startswith(f"agent/{agent_id}/")
    assert os.path.exists(work_tree_info["work_tree_path"])
    
    # And work tree is properly isolated
    assert not shares_files_with_other_work_trees(work_tree_info["work_tree_path"])

def test_multiple_work_tree_isolation():
    # Given multiple agents working on same repository
    repo_url = "https://github.com/myorg/shared-project"
    agent_1 = "agent-alice"
    agent_2 = "agent-bob"
    
    # When both agents set up work trees
    work_tree_1 = github_integration.setup_repository(repo_url, agent_1)
    work_tree_2 = github_integration.setup_repository(repo_url, agent_2)
    
    # Then work trees are completely isolated
    assert work_tree_1.work_tree_path != work_tree_2.work_tree_path
    assert work_tree_1.branch_name != work_tree_2.branch_name
    
    # And changes in one don't affect the other
    create_file_in_work_tree(work_tree_1.work_tree_path, "agent1_file.txt")
    create_file_in_work_tree(work_tree_2.work_tree_path, "agent2_file.txt")
    
    assert not file_exists_in_work_tree(work_tree_2.work_tree_path, "agent1_file.txt")
    assert not file_exists_in_work_tree(work_tree_1.work_tree_path, "agent2_file.txt")
```

### Story 2: Automated Pull Request Management
**As a** development team  
**I want** agents to automatically create and manage pull requests  
**So that** code changes follow proper review processes

**Acceptance Tests:**
```python
def test_automated_pull_request_creation():
    # Given an agent with code changes
    agent_id = "feature-agent"
    work_tree = setup_agent_work_tree(agent_id, "myorg/myproject")
    
    # Make some changes
    modify_file_in_work_tree(work_tree.path, "src/main.py", "Added new feature")
    commit_changes(work_tree.path, "Implement user authentication feature")
    
    # When creating pull request
    pr_response = github_integration.create_pull_request(
        repository="myorg/myproject",
        source_branch=work_tree.branch_name,
        target_branch="main",
        title="Add user authentication feature",
        description="Implements OAuth 2.0 authentication with role-based access control",
        agent_id=agent_id
    )
    
    # Then PR is created successfully
    assert pr_response.status_code == 200
    pr_info = pr_response.json()
    
    assert pr_info["pr_number"] > 0
    assert "github.com" in pr_info["pr_url"]
    
    # And PR has proper metadata
    pr_details = github_api.get_pull_request("myorg/myproject", pr_info["pr_number"])
    assert f"Agent: {agent_id}" in pr_details.body
    assert "automated-agent" in pr_details.labels

def test_pull_request_review_automation():
    # Given a pull request created by an agent
    pr = create_test_pull_request("myorg/myproject", "feature-branch")
    
    # When triggering automated review
    review_result = github_integration.perform_automated_review(
        repository="myorg/myproject",
        pr_number=pr.number,
        review_types=["security", "performance", "style"]
    )
    
    # Then comprehensive review is performed
    assert review_result.completed == True
    assert len(review_result.findings) > 0
    
    # And review comments are posted to GitHub
    pr_comments = github_api.get_pr_comments("myorg/myproject", pr.number)
    security_comments = [c for c in pr_comments if "security" in c.body.lower()]
    assert len(security_comments) > 0
```

### Story 3: Issue Management and Assignment
**As a** project manager  
**I want** agents to automatically pick up and work on GitHub issues  
**So that** development work is efficiently distributed

**Acceptance Tests:**
```python
def test_automated_issue_assignment():
    # Given open issues in repository
    repository = "myorg/myproject"
    issues = [
        create_github_issue(repository, "Fix login bug", labels=["bug", "priority:high"]),
        create_github_issue(repository, "Add user dashboard", labels=["feature", "priority:medium"]),
        create_github_issue(repository, "Update documentation", labels=["docs", "priority:low"])
    ]
    
    # When agent requests issue assignment
    assignment_response = github_integration.assign_issues_to_agent(
        repository=repository,
        agent_id="bug-fix-agent",
        agent_capabilities=["bug_fixing", "testing"],
        max_issues=2
    )
    
    # Then appropriate issues are assigned
    assert assignment_response.status_code == 200
    assigned_issues = assignment_response.json()["assigned_issues"]
    
    assert len(assigned_issues) <= 2
    # Bug-fix agent should get the bug issue
    bug_issue = next((i for i in assigned_issues if "bug" in i["labels"]), None)
    assert bug_issue is not None

def test_issue_progress_tracking():
    # Given an assigned issue
    issue = create_assigned_issue("myorg/myproject", "bug-fix-agent", "Fix memory leak")
    
    # When agent updates issue progress
    progress_updates = [
        {"status": "investigating", "comment": "Analyzing memory usage patterns"},
        {"status": "in_progress", "comment": "Identified cause in data processing loop"},
        {"status": "testing", "comment": "Implemented fix, running tests"},
        {"status": "resolved", "comment": "Fix confirmed, ready for review"}
    ]
    
    for update in progress_updates:
        github_integration.update_issue_progress(
            repository="myorg/myproject",
            issue_number=issue.number,
            agent_id="bug-fix-agent",
            status=update["status"],
            comment=update["comment"]
        )
    
    # Then issue status is properly tracked
    issue_history = github_integration.get_issue_history(
        repository="myorg/myproject",
        issue_number=issue.number
    )
    
    assert len(issue_history.status_changes) == 4
    assert issue_history.current_status == "resolved"
    assert issue_history.time_to_resolution < 86400  # Less than 24 hours
```

### Story 4: Branch Management and Conflict Resolution
**As an** AI agent  
**I want** to manage branches automatically and resolve simple conflicts  
**So that** development workflow remains smooth

**Acceptance Tests:**
```python
def test_automatic_branch_management():
    # Given an agent working on a feature
    agent_id = "feature-agent"
    work_tree = setup_agent_work_tree(agent_id, "myorg/myproject")
    
    # When main branch is updated while agent is working
    simulate_main_branch_update("myorg/myproject", ["new_file.py", "updated_readme.md"])
    
    # And agent attempts to sync with main
    sync_result = github_integration.sync_with_main_branch(
        agent_id=agent_id,
        repository="myorg/myproject"
    )
    
    # Then branch is successfully updated
    assert sync_result.success == True
    assert sync_result.conflicts_resolved == 0  # No conflicts in this case
    
    # And work tree reflects latest changes
    assert file_exists_in_work_tree(work_tree.path, "new_file.py")
    assert file_exists_in_work_tree(work_tree.path, "updated_readme.md")

def test_simple_conflict_resolution():
    # Given two agents modifying the same file differently
    agent_1_work_tree = setup_agent_work_tree("agent-1", "myorg/myproject")
    agent_2_work_tree = setup_agent_work_tree("agent-2", "myorg/myproject")
    
    # Both modify the same file
    modify_file_in_work_tree(agent_1_work_tree.path, "config.py", "TIMEOUT = 30")
    modify_file_in_work_tree(agent_2_work_tree.path, "config.py", "TIMEOUT = 60")
    
    # Agent 1 merges first
    commit_and_merge(agent_1_work_tree, "Update timeout to 30 seconds")
    
    # When agent 2 tries to merge
    merge_result = github_integration.attempt_merge(
        agent_id="agent-2",
        repository="myorg/myproject",
        conflict_resolution_strategy="prefer_larger_timeout"
    )
    
    # Then conflict is automatically resolved
    assert merge_result.success == True
    assert merge_result.conflicts_detected == 1
    assert merge_result.conflicts_resolved == 1
    
    # And final file has correct resolution
    final_content = get_file_content("myorg/myproject", "config.py", "main")
    assert "TIMEOUT = 60" in final_content  # Larger timeout was preferred
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core GitHub Integration (Week 1-2)
- GitHub API client setup with authentication
- Basic repository cloning and work tree management
- Simple branch creation and management
- Pull request creation functionality

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Week 2-3)
- Automated code review and analysis
- Issue management and assignment
- Conflict detection and simple resolution
- Webhook integration for real-time updates

### Phase 3: Optimization and Polish (Week 3)
- Performance optimization for large repositories
- Advanced conflict resolution strategies
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

## Security Considerations
- All GitHub API calls use personal access tokens with minimal required scopes
- Work trees are isolated using filesystem permissions
- Agent commits are cryptographically signed for authenticity
- Webhook endpoints use secret validation to prevent spoofing
- Regular audit of repository access permissions

## Dependencies
- GitHub REST/GraphQL APIs
- Git command-line tools
- File system isolation mechanisms
- Webhook processing infrastructure
- Code analysis tools for automated review

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Work tree corruption affecting multiple agents  
**Mitigation**: Complete isolation, regular backups, atomic operations

**Risk**: GitHub API rate limiting  
**Mitigation**: Request caching, intelligent batching, retry with exponential backoff

**Risk**: Merge conflicts breaking automated workflows  
**Mitigation**: Conservative conflict resolution, human escalation for complex conflicts

**Risk**: Unauthorized repository access  
**Mitigation**: Minimal permission scopes, regular access audits, token rotation

This PRD enables Claude Code agents to build a comprehensive GitHub integration system that supports modern software development workflows while maintaining security and isolation between different agents and projects.
