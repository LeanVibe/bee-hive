## Best Practices

### Effective Agent Management

#### Agent Configuration Best Practices

1. **Realistic Capability Assessment:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Good Practice:
   - Assess actual skills and experience levels
   - Update capabilities based on performance
   - Use specific, measurable skill tags
   - Set appropriate concurrent task limits
   
   ‚ùå Poor Practice:
   - Overestimate agent capabilities
   - Use vague or generic skill descriptions
   - Set unrealistic performance expectations
   - Ignore agent performance feedback
   ```

2. **Performance Monitoring:**
   - Review agent metrics regularly
   - Adjust workloads based on performance
   - Provide feedback for improvement
   - Recognize high-performing agents

#### Task Creation Best Practices

1. **Clear Task Definition:**
