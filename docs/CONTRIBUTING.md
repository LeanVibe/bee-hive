# Documentation Contributing Guide

**How to contribute to and maintain the LeanVibe Agent Hive documentation system**

---

## üéØ Overview

This guide explains how to work with the Agent Hive documentation system, including our new organizational structure, contribution workflows, and maintenance procedures. Following these guidelines ensures consistent, discoverable, and maintainable documentation.

## üìÇ New Documentation Structure

### Directory Organization

The documentation is organized into six primary directories:

```
docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prd/           # Product Requirements Documents
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ implementation/# Implementation guides and status
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ enterprise/    # Enterprise materials and deployment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/           # API references and integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user/          # User guides and tutorials
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/       # Historical and deprecated content
```

### Directory Purposes

| Directory | Purpose | Content Types | Audience |
|-----------|---------|---------------|----------|
| `prd/` | Authoritative specifications | System architecture, feature requirements, technical specs | Developers, Architects |
| `implementation/` | Current progress & guides | Status updates, migration guides, implementation steps | Development Teams |
| `enterprise/` | Enterprise-focused materials | Deployment guides, security procedures, business docs | IT Admin, Enterprise Users |
| `api/` | API documentation | Endpoint specs, schemas, integration examples | API Consumers, Integrators |
| `user/` | End-user documentation | Tutorials, how-tos, troubleshooting | End Users, Administrators |
| `archive/` | Historical content | Deprecated docs, old versions, phase reports | Historical Reference Only |

## üìù Document Placement Decision Matrix

### Where Should Your Document Go?

**Ask These Questions:**

1. **What is the primary purpose?**
   - System specification ‚Üí `prd/`
   - Implementation guide ‚Üí `implementation/`
   - User instruction ‚Üí `user/`
   - API documentation ‚Üí `api/`
   - Enterprise procedure ‚Üí `enterprise/`

2. **Who is the primary audience?**
   - Developers building the system ‚Üí `prd/` or `implementation/`
   - Users operating the system ‚Üí `user/` or `enterprise/`
   - Integrators using APIs ‚Üí `api/`
   - Historical reference ‚Üí `archive/`

3. **What is the document lifecycle?**
   - Living specification ‚Üí `prd/`
   - Current status/progress ‚Üí `implementation/`
   - Stable user guide ‚Üí `user/`
   - Deprecated content ‚Üí `archive/`

### Decision Tree

```

## üîÑ Contribution Workflow

### Creating New Documentation

1. **Determine Placement**
   - Use the decision matrix above to identify the correct directory
   - Check if similar documentation already exists
   - Consider if you're updating existing content vs. creating new

2. **Follow Naming Conventions**
   ```
   descriptive-name.md           # Good: clear and descriptive
   COMPONENT_SYSTEM_SPEC.md      # Avoid: ALL_CAPS, use kebab-case
   temp-notes.md                 # Avoid: temporary or vague names
   ```

3. **Use Document Template**
   ```markdown
   # Document Title
   
   **Brief description of document purpose**
   
   ---
   
   ## Overview
   [Introduction and context]
   
   ## [Main Sections]
   [Content organized logically]
   
   ---
   
   **Last Updated**: [Date]
   **Version**: [Version Number]
   **Maintained By**: [Team/Person]
   ```

4. **Update Master Index**
   - Add your document to the appropriate section in `docs/README.md`
   - Include a brief description of the document's purpose
   - Ensure the link is correct and functional

### Updating Existing Documentation

1. **Identify the Authoritative Source**
   - Check `docs/README.md` for the canonical version
   - Avoid creating duplicate content
   - If multiple versions exist, consolidate or update references

2. **Preserve Structure**
   - Maintain existing section organization
   - Update content while keeping formatting consistent
   - Preserve important historical context where relevant

3. **Update Metadata**
   - Change "Last Updated" date
   - Increment version number appropriately
   - Update maintainer information if necessary

4. **Review Cross-References**
   - Check that all internal links still work
   - Update references to moved or renamed documents
   - Ensure related documents are updated as needed

### Quality Checklist

Before submitting documentation:

- [ ] **Clarity**: Is the purpose clear from the title and first paragraph?
- [ ] **Completeness**: Does it cover all necessary information for the intended audience?
- [ ] **Accuracy**: Is all information current and correct?
- [ ] **Structure**: Is content organized logically with proper headings?
- [ ] **Links**: Do all internal and external links work?
- [ ] **Formatting**: Is markdown syntax correct and consistent?
- [ ] **Index**: Is the document properly linked in `docs/README.md`?

## üóÇÔ∏è Archival Process

### When to Archive Documents

Archive documents when they are:
- **Superseded**: Replaced by newer, more comprehensive versions
- **Outdated**: No longer relevant to current system state
- **Deprecated**: Related to discontinued features or approaches
- **Historical**: Valuable for context but not for current operations

### Archival Procedure

1. **Determine Archive Category**
   ```
   archive/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deprecated/     # Documents that are no longer valid
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ old-versions/   # Previous versions of current documents  
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ phase-reports/  # Completed project phase documentation
   ```

2. **Add Deprecation Watermark**
   Add this header to archived documents:
   ```markdown
   > **--- ARCHIVED DOCUMENT ---**
   > **This document is historical and no longer maintained. Do not use for current work.**
   > **The authoritative source for this topic is now [Link to new document].**
   > ---
   ```

3. **Update Cross-References**
   - Find all documents that link to the archived content
   - Update links to point to current authoritative sources
   - Use search tools to find references: `grep -r "old-filename" docs/`

4. **Update Master Index**
   - Remove the document from active sections in `docs/README.md`
   - Add reference to archived location if historically significant
   - Update any related navigation elements

### Archive Validation

After archiving:

- [ ] Original document moved to appropriate archive subdirectory
- [ ] Deprecation watermark added with link to replacement
- [ ] All cross-references updated to point to current sources
- [ ] Master index updated to reflect changes
- [ ] No broken links remain in active documentation

---

## üîç Link Management and Validation

### Link Checking Process

Regular link validation helps maintain documentation quality:

1. **Automated Checking**
   ```bash
   # Check for broken links in all markdown files
   find docs/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "http" {} \; | xargs -I {} echo "Checking: {}"
   
   # Find references to specific files
   grep -r "filename.md" docs/
   ```

2. **Manual Validation**
   - Test all links in newly created or updated documents
   - Verify that cross-references resolve correctly
   - Check that external links are current and accessible

3. **Common Link Issues**
   - Relative paths that break when documents move
   - References to archived documents without watermarks
   - External links that have become invalid
   - Case-sensitive filename mismatches

### Link Best Practices

- **Use relative paths** for internal links: `../user/guide.md`
- **Use descriptive link text**: `[User Guide](user/guide.md)` not `[here](user/guide.md)`
- **Verify links before submitting** changes
- **Update related documents** when moving or renaming files
