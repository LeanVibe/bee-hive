# Claude Code Master Prompt: LeanVibe Agent Hive System Transformation

## üéØ Primary Mission

You are the lead architect for transforming the LeanVibe Agent Hive from a feature-rich but complex system into a production-ready, enterprise-grade platform. Your task is to **plan comprehensively** and **execute systematically** a 4-epic transformation that consolidates 200+ files into 50 core modules, builds 90% test coverage from zero, and achieves enterprise production readiness.

## üìä Critical System Analysis

### ‚úÖ **Foundation Strengths (Build Upon These)**
**Project Index Feature - PRODUCTION READY**:
- ‚úÖ Complete database schema (5 tables, migrations up to 023)
- ‚úÖ Core infrastructure: ProjectIndexer, CodeAnalyzer, file monitoring, Redis caching
- ‚úÖ 8 REST API endpoints + AI-powered context optimization  
- ‚úÖ 4 WebSocket event types with real-time subscription management
- ‚úÖ 8 interactive PWA dashboard components with D3.js visualizations
- ‚úÖ Multi-agent integration with context-aware coordination
- ‚úÖ Quality assurance patterns established

### üö® **Critical Transformation Targets**

#### 1. **System Complexity Crisis** (IMMEDIATE)
```
Current: app/core/ = 200+ files with massive redundancy
Target: app/core/ = 50 core modules, single unified orchestrator
Impact: 75% complexity reduction, 300% maintenance efficiency
Timeline: Epic 1 (Weeks 1-3)
```

#### 2. **Testing Infrastructure Void** (CRITICAL)
```
Current: ~0% comprehensive test coverage
Target: 90% test coverage with automated quality gates
Impact: Production deployment confidence, regression prevention
Timeline: Epic 2 (Weeks 4-6)
```

#### 3. **Integration Gap** (HIGH PRIORITY)
```
Current: Project Index isolated, not integrated into main app
Target: Full integration with main app, unified WebSocket, auth flow
Impact: Immediate user value, feature accessibility
Timeline: Epic 1, Phase 2 (Week 2)
```

#### 4. **Documentation Chaos** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
```
Current: 500+ fragmented documentation files
Target: 50 canonical sources with living documentation
Impact: 50% faster developer onboarding, knowledge accessibility
Timeline: Epic 3 (Weeks 7-9)
```

## üèóÔ∏è **Strategic Implementation Framework**

### **Phase 1: Strategic Planning & Assessment (Week 1)**

**Your First Task: Create Master Implementation Plan**

1. **System Architecture Audit**
   ```bash
   # Analyze current complexity
   find app/core/ -name "*.py" | xargs wc -l | sort -rn
   ls app/core/ | grep -E "(orchestrator|coordinator|manager)" | wc -l
   find app/api/ -name "*.py" | grep -v __pycache__ | wc -l
   
   # Map dependencies and redundancy
   grep -r "from app.core" app/ | cut -d: -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
   ```

2. **Integration Assessment**
   ```bash
   # Check Project Index integration status
   grep -r "project_index" app/main.py || echo "NOT INTEGRATED"
   grep -r "project-index" mobile-pwa/src/main.ts || echo "FRONTEND NOT INTEGRATED"
   ```

### **Agent Delegation Constraints**
- **Max 3 major tasks per agent per session** (context limits)
- **Clear deliverables and success criteria** for each delegation
- **Regular coordination between agents** (prevent conflicts)
- **Shared documentation and decision tracking**

### **Production Safety**
- **All database changes require migration rollback plans**
- **API changes require backward compatibility**
