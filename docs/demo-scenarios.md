### Common Customer Questions & Responses

#### "How does this compare to GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT?"
**Response:** "Those are single-agent tools that work sequentially. We're the only platform with true multi-agent coordination. Five specialists working in parallel, with real-time task handoffs and dependency management."

#### "Is this production-ready code or just demos?"
**Response:** "This generates enterprise-grade, production-ready code. Notice the security implementations, test coverage above 90%, performance optimizations, and complete CI/CD pipelines. We're not building toys - we're building real software."

#### "How do you handle complex requirements or changes?"
**Response:** "Our agents adapt in real-time. If requirements change mid-project, the orchestrator automatically redistributes tasks, updates dependencies, and maintains consistency across the entire codebase."

#### "What about code quality and maintenance?"
**Response:** "Every project includes comprehensive testing, security audits, performance optimization, and complete documentation. Our agents follow enterprise best practices that most human developers skip under pressure."

#### "How much does this cost compared to hiring developers?"
**Response:** "Consider this: we just delivered 2-3 weeks of development work in 15 minutes. Even if we charged enterprise rates, the ROI is obvious. But we're more cost-effective than traditional development while delivering higher quality."
