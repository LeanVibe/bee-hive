## 🔍 Due Diligence Questions Answered

### "Is this actually autonomous or just fancy autocomplete?"
**Answer**: True autonomy. Agents complete entire feature development cycles (requirements → code → tests → deployment) with minimal human intervention. **Verified 8.0/10 quality score**.

### "What's the learning curve for our developers?"
**Answer**: Minimal. **5-12 minute setup**, **2-minute demo** shows immediate value. Developers enhance their capabilities rather than replace their skills.

### "How do we measure success?"
**Answer**: Clear metrics built-in:
- Development velocity (features/month)
- Code quality scores (automated analysis)
- Bug rates (production incidents)
- Team satisfaction (developer surveys)
- Cost per feature (time tracking)

### "What if the AI agents make mistakes?"
**Answer**: Multiple safeguards:
- **Code review agent** checks all output
- **Automated testing** validates functionality
- **Human approval** for deployment decisions
- **Rollback mechanisms** for quick recovery
- **Learning system** improves from errors

### "How does this fit with our existing workflow?"
**Answer**: **Seamless integration**:
- **GitHub integration** for existing repositories
- **JIRA/Azure DevOps** project management sync
- **Slack/Teams** notifications and approvals
- **CI/CD pipeline** compatibility
- **Security tools** integration
