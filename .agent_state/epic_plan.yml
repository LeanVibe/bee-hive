# Notes and Observations
notes:
  - Previous session fixed 3 critical background errors (enum casting, circuit breaker, coordination bridge)
  - System operational at ~80% but test failures prevent confident development
  - XP principle: Fix tests first to enable rapid iteration
  - Using 25-minute focused batches for sustainable progress
