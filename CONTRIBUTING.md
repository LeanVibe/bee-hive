# Contributing to LeanVibe Agent Hive

We love your input! We want to make contributing to LeanVibe Agent Hive as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 15+ (or use Docker)
- Redis 7+ (or use Docker)

### Setup Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bee-hive.git
cd bee-hive

# 2. Set up Python environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .

# 3. Start services
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# 4. Run migrations
alembic upgrade head

# 5. Set up frontend (choose one or both)
# Vue.js Web Dashboard
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# Mobile PWA Dashboard
cd mobile-pwa && npm install && cd ..

# 6. Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Frontend (Vue.js)
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Mobile PWA
cd mobile-pwa && npm run dev
```

## Code Quality Standards

### Python

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code
black app/ tests/

# Check linting
ruff check app/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy app/

# Run tests
pytest -v --cov=app
```

**Code Style Guidelines:**
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Write docstrings for public functions and classes
- Use async/await for all I/O operations
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black default)

### TypeScript/JavaScript

For both frontends:

```bash
# Mobile PWA
cd mobile-pwa
npm run lint        # ESLint
npm run type-check  # TypeScript checking
npm test           # Unit tests

# Vue.js Frontend
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm test
```

**Frontend Guidelines:**
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow established component patterns
- Write unit tests for complex logic
- Use semantic HTML for accessibility
- Follow mobile-first responsive design principles

## Testing Requirements

### Minimum Coverage

- **Backend**: 90% test coverage required
- **Frontend**: 80% test coverage required
- **E2E**: Critical user flows must be covered

### Testing Strategy

```bash
# Backend unit tests
pytest tests/unit/

# Backend integration tests
pytest tests/integration/

# Backend E2E tests
pytest tests/e2e/

# Frontend unit tests
cd frontend && npm test

# Mobile PWA unit tests
cd mobile-pwa && npm test

# Mobile PWA E2E tests
cd mobile-pwa && npm run test:e2e
```

### Writing Tests

**Backend Tests:**
```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_create_agent(client: AsyncClient):
    response = await client.post("/api/v1/agents/", json={
        "name": "test-agent",
        "role": "developer"
    })
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json()["name"] == "test-agent"
```

**Frontend Tests:**
```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import { AgentCard } from './AgentCard'

test('renders agent name', () => {
  render(<AgentCard name="test-agent" status="active" />)
  expect(screen.getByText('test-agent')).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- **Python**: Use Google-style docstrings
- **TypeScript**: Use JSDoc comments for complex functions
- **API**: Update OpenAPI schemas when changing endpoints

### User Documentation

When adding features that affect user experience:

1. Update relevant documentation in `docs/`
2. Add examples to README if applicable
3. Update API documentation if endpoints change

## Submitting Changes
