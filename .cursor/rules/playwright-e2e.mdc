# Playwright E2E Guidelines

- Install deps and browsers before running tests:

```sh
cd mobile-pwa && npm ci && npx playwright install --with-deps
```

- Always include a smoke test that verifies navigation and initial data render on `/dashboard`.
- Save screenshots under `mobile-pwa/test-results/` for manual review.
- Prefer short, stable selectors (data-testids) over brittle text selectors.
- MCP Playwright review each major screen before closing tasks.
