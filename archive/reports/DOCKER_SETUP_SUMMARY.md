- **Intelligent health checks** across all services
- **Comprehensive logging** with structured output
- **Debug port exposure** for IDE attachment (port 5678)

### Service Architecture
- **Core Services**: PostgreSQL with pgvector, Redis with persistence
- **Development Tools**: pgAdmin, Redis Commander, Adminer
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus, Grafana, Node Exporter, cAdvisor
- **Testing Environment**: Isolated containers for testing
- **Frontend PWA**: Complete Vite development server with HMR

### Production Readiness
- **Multi-stage Dockerfiles** for optimized production builds
- **Security hardening** with non-root users and proper permissions
- **Resource limits** and health checks for container orchestration
- **Nginx reverse proxy** configuration for production deployment
- **Environment-specific configurations** for development vs production

### Data Persistence
- **Named volumes** for PostgreSQL data, Redis persistence, logs
- **Development-friendly** data retention between container restarts
- **Backup-ready** volume structure for database backups
- **Proper permissions** handling for shared volumes

## üìã Available Commands

### Quick Start Commands
```bash

## üéØ Next Steps for Developers

### 1. Initial Setup (Required)
```bash
# Clone repository and navigate to it
cd leanvibe-dev/bee-hive

# Set up Docker environment
make docker-setup

# Edit .env.docker and add your API keys
# At minimum, add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Start development environment
make docker-dev
```

### 2. Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# Start services in background
make docker-dev-bg

# Check everything is healthy
make docker-health

# View logs if needed
make docker-logs

# Work on your code (hot reload active!)
# Backend changes auto-reload via uvicorn
# Frontend changes auto-reload via Vite HMR

# Run tests
make docker-test

# Stop when done
make docker-stop
```

### 3. Troubleshooting Resources
- Run `make docker-health` to check service status
- Use `make docker-logs` to view all service logs
- Consult `DOCKER_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting
- Use `make docker-clean` for cleanup if issues persist
