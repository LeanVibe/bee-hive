- Circuit breaker pattern for resilience
- Comprehensive monitoring and metrics
- Standardized lifecycle management

**Key Features**:
- Generic type support for specialized managers
- Plugin interface for modular functionality  
- Performance monitoring built-in
- Error handling with circuit breaker
- Async/await throughout for performance

### 🔌 Plugin Architecture

Each unified manager supports plugins through the `PluginInterface`:
- **Performance Plugins**: Custom optimization strategies
- **Security Plugins**: Specialized authentication/authorization
- **Context Plugins**: Domain-specific compression algorithms
- **Communication Plugins**: Custom message routing

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability

Built-in monitoring for all managers:
- Real-time performance metrics
- Error tracking and alerting
- Resource usage monitoring
- Plugin performance analysis
- Circuit breaker status

## Backward Compatibility Strategy

### 🔄 Zero Breaking Changes

**Compatibility Layer Components**:
1. `_compatibility_adapters.py` - Main adapter logic
2. Individual `*_compat.py` files for each deprecated module
3. `install_compatibility_layer.py` - Installation script
4. Transparent import redirection

**Migration Strategy**:
- Phase 1: Install compatibility layer ✅
- Phase 2: Update imports gradually ✅
- Phase 3: Remove compatibility layer (future)

### 📦 Compatibility Files Created

- `agent_spawner_compat.py` → `agent_manager.AgentManager`
- `messaging_service_compat.py` → `communication_manager.CommunicationManager`
- `context_compression_compat.py` → `context_manager_unified.ContextManagerUnified`
- `workflow_engine_compat.py` → `workflow_manager.WorkflowManager`
- `performance_optimizer_compat.py` → `resource_manager.ResourceManager`
- `security_audit_compat.py` → `security_manager.SecurityManager`
