### Memory Usage
- Cannot accurately assess due to runtime errors
- Multiple error handlers consuming resources

## Security Assessment

### HTTPS/Security Headers
- Running on HTTP (localhost) - appropriate for development
- Meta tags configured correctly for production security

### Content Security Policy
- No obvious XSS vulnerabilities in test infrastructure
- Error handling could expose sensitive debug information

## Recommendations

## Conclusion

While the LeanVibe Agent Hive Dashboard has a solid architectural foundation and comprehensive feature set, critical runtime and build issues prevent proper functionality testing. The immediate focus should be on resolving the duplicate method definitions, service worker configuration, and basic rendering issues.

Once these fundamental issues are resolved, the extensive test infrastructure created will provide comprehensive coverage of the dashboard's advanced features including multi-agent coordination, advanced Kanban management, sprint planning, and real-time collaboration capabilities.

The test framework is ready and comprehensive - it's the application code that needs immediate attention to enable proper testing and functionality validation.

## Next Steps

1. **Address Critical Issues**: Fix duplicate methods and service worker configuration
2. **Resolve Rendering Problems**: Ensure basic UI functionality works
3. **Re-run Test Suite**: Validate fixes with comprehensive test execution
4. **Performance Testing**: Once functional, conduct load and performance testing
5. **User Acceptance Testing**: Validate enhanced features with real user scenarios
