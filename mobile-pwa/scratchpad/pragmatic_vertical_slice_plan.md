# Pragmatic Vertical Slice Plan: Autonomous Dashboard Bootstrap
## Leveraging Multi-Agent System for Maximum Compounding Effects

**Plan Date:** January 4, 2025

## Strategic Foundation: Why This Approach Works

### The Pragmatic Insight
**We have a working autonomous development platform that we're not using to develop its own features.** This is the classic "shoemaker's children go barefoot" problem solved through strategic self-application.

### Compounding Effects Strategy
1. **Each feature validates the platform** while delivering functionality
2. **System learns from its own development** improving future capabilities  
3. **Live demonstration** provides unassailable proof for enterprise customers
4. **Technical debt reduces** through self-discovery and resolution
5. **Knowledge compounds** creating transferable patterns for customer projects
