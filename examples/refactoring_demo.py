Technical Debt Phase 1 Demonstration: Main Pattern Refactoring

This file demonstrates the value of standardizing main() patterns using ScriptBase.

BEFORE (Traditional Pattern - 25+ lines of boilerplate):
```python
# Global instance
validator = DisasterRecoveryValidator()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run comprehensive disaster recovery tests
    async def run_dr_tests():
        results = await validator.run_comprehensive_disaster_recovery_tests()
        print(json.dumps({
            "test_suite": results.test_suite,
            "overall_success": results.overall_success,
            "scenarios_tested": results.scenarios_tested,
            "scenarios_passed": results.scenarios_passed,
            "scenarios_failed": results.scenarios_failed,
            "business_continuity_impact": results.business_continuity_impact,
            "recommendations": results.recommendations,
            "lessons_learned": results.lessons_learned
        }, indent=2))
        
    asyncio.run(run_dr_tests())
```

AFTER (ScriptBase Pattern - 5 lines total):
```python
# Standardized script execution pattern
validator = DisasterRecoveryValidator()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    validator.execute()
```

BENEFITS:
- Eliminates 20+ lines of boilerplate per file
- Consistent error handling and logging across all scripts
- Standardized JSON output format
- Automatic metrics collection and reporting
- Better maintainability and reduced cognitive load
