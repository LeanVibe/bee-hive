## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE FOUNDATION

### Database Design Excellence
```sql
-- Example: BusinessMetric with time-series and metadata support
business_metrics (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    metric_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    metric_type MetricType NOT NULL,
    metric_value DECIMAL(12,4) NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    metadata JSONB,
    tags TEXT[],
    source_system VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### Service Layer Architecture
```python
# Executive Dashboard with real-time parallel data collection
class ExecutiveDashboard:
    async def get_current_metrics(self) -> BusinessMetrics:
        # Parallel data gathering for performance
        metrics_data = await asyncio.gather(
            self._get_user_metrics(session),
            self._get_agent_metrics(session),
            self._get_task_metrics(session),
            self._get_system_performance_metrics(session)
        )
        return self._aggregate_business_metrics(metrics_data)
```

### API Integration Pattern
```python
# Business Analytics API with comprehensive error handling
@router.get("/analytics/dashboard", response_model=BusinessMetricsResponse)
async def get_executive_dashboard_data():
    """Real-time executive KPIs with filtering and alerting."""
    dashboard = await get_executive_dashboard()
    return await dashboard.get_dashboard_data()
