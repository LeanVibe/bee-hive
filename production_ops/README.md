# Epic 8: Production Operations Excellence

**Mission**: Transform LeanVibe Agent Hive 2.0 from validated system to production-deployed platform with 99.9% uptime and enterprise operations.

## Overview

Epic 8 builds upon Epic 7's **94.4% test pass rate** achievement to establish enterprise-grade production operations, enabling:

- **99.9% Uptime SLA**: Industry-standard reliability for enterprise customers
- **Auto-scaling**: 60-second response to load changes, targeting 867.5+ req/s
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Full observability with intelligent alerting
- **Security Excellence**: RBAC, network policies, and compliance frameworks
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployment with Epic 7 quality gates
- **Production Deployment**: Real Kubernetes infrastructure with high availability
