# ðŸ§˜ LeanVibe Agent Hive - Meditation Cycle

Deep reflection mode for consolidating learnings, recognizing patterns, and extracting wisdom from autonomous development experiences.

## Meditation Focus: $ARGUMENTS

### Available Meditation Types:
- **integration**: Synthesize recent learnings and experiences
- **patterns**: Identify recurring themes and successful approaches
- **lessons**: Extract wisdom from challenges and breakthroughs
- **wisdom**: Deep philosophical insights about autonomous development

## Current Reflection Context
- Session Experience: !`cat /Users/bogdan/.claude/memory/session_context.md | grep -c "âœ…" || echo "0"` achievements logged
- Pattern Recognition: !`find /Users/bogdan/.claude/memory -name "*.json" | wc -l | xargs -I {} echo "{} structured insights"`
- Learning Depth: !`cat /Users/bogdan/.claude/memory/reflection.md | wc -l || echo "0"` reflection lines
