2. **Security Middleware Import**: Fixed incorrect import paths (`fastapi.middleware.base` ‚Üí `starlette.middleware.base`)
3. **Demo Server Path Issues**: Fixed directory path handling for any-directory execution

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING CRITICAL TASKS (Honest Assessment)

### HIGH PRIORITY (2-4 hours remaining work):
1. **Setup Script Automation**: Fix interactive prompts hanging, achieve true one-command setup
2. **Comprehensive Integration Testing**: Validate all new components work together end-to-end

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Technical debt, 1-2 days):
3. **Pydantic V2 Migration**: Resolve 305 deprecation warnings throughout codebase
