# 🚀 LeanVibe Agent Hive 2.0 - Quick Start Guide

## Core Commands

### System Control
```bash
/hive start    # Start complete system with auto-recovery
/hive demo     # 60-second autonomous development demo
/hive mobile   # Generate mobile QR code for remote oversight
/hive status   # Comprehensive system health check
/hive fix      # Intelligent error detection and repair
/hive stop     # Clean shutdown
```

### Session Management
```bash
/sleep [light|deep|emergency]    # Intelligent context consolidation
/wake [quick|full|validate]      # Session restoration with system check
/dream [innovation|optimization] # Creative processing and breakthroughs
/meditate [integration|patterns] # Learning consolidation and wisdom
```

## 📱 Mobile Oversight

1. Run `/hive mobile` to generate QR code
2. Scan with mobile device for instant dashboard access
3. Monitor agent activity and make critical decisions remotely
4. Emergency controls: stop/pause/resume from anywhere

## 🎯 60-Second Demo Flow

The `/hive demo` command executes:
1. **System Verification** (0-10s): Ensure all services ready
2. **Agent Spawning** (10-20s): Deploy specialized development team
3. **Task Assignment** (20-25s): Create authentication API project
4. **Autonomous Development** (25-55s): Watch agents collaborate
5. **Verification** (55-60s): Validate working code delivery

## 🛠️ Intelligent Error Recovery

The system automatically handles:
- ✅ Port conflicts (kills competing processes)
- ✅ Docker service issues (auto-restart)
- ✅ Database connectivity (migration runner)
- ✅ API server problems (intelligent restart)
- ✅ Agent coordination failures (team reactivation)

## 🎨 Developer Experience Features

### Auto Quality Gates
- Syntax checking on file saves
- Security scanning for leaked credentials  
- LeanVibe-specific best practices
- Automatic system health monitoring

### Context Management
- Smart memory optimization when context fills
- Agent state preservation during sleep/wake
- Mobile-critical events buffered for notifications

### Session Intelligence
- Automatic system status on session end
- Actionable recommendations based on system state
- Quick commands for common operations

## 🏆 Success Metrics

**Setup Time**: 60 seconds (from command to working system)  
**Demo Time**: 60 seconds (prove autonomous development)  
**Error Recovery**: Automatic (no manual intervention needed)  
**Mobile Access**: Instant (QR code → oversight dashboard)

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

**System Down**: `/hive fix` → automatic diagnosis and repair  
**Demo Failed**: Check `/hive status` → follow recommendations  
**Mobile Needed**: `/hive mobile` → scan QR for instant access  
**Clean Reset**: `/hive stop` → `/hive start` → full system refresh

## 🧠 Intelligent Session Management

### Sleep Cycles (Context > 85%)
- **`/sleep light`**: Quick consolidation for short breaks
- **`/sleep deep`**: Full session summary with agent state preservation  
- **`/sleep emergency`**: Rapid state save for critical situations

### Wake Restoration
- **`/wake quick`**: Fast context restoration (2-3 min)
- **`/wake full`**: Complete system validation and restoration
- **`/wake validate`**: System health check with recommendations

### Creative Processing
- **`/dream innovation`**: Explore breakthrough development possibilities
- **`/dream optimization`**: Deep performance and efficiency analysis
- **`/dream architecture`**: Envision next-generation system designs

### Learning Integration  
- **`/meditate integration`**: Synthesize recent learnings and experiences
- **`/meditate patterns`**: Identify recurring themes and successful approaches
- **`/meditate lessons`**: Extract wisdom from challenges and breakthroughs

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Always start with `/hive status` to understand current state
- Use `/sleep` when context gets heavy instead of stopping mid-task
- `/wake` automatically restores your previous session context
- `/dream` for breakthrough innovations during quiet development time
- `/meditate` after major milestones to consolidate learnings
- Use `/hive mobile` to monitor long-running autonomous tasks
- The `/hive demo` is perfect for client demonstrations
- Quality gates run automatically - no manual code review needed
- System learns from each session to improve performance
