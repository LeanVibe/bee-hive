## Target Architecture Design

### **Unified Engine Interface**
```python
class BaseEngine(ABC):
    """Base interface for all specialized engines."""
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def initialize(self, config: EngineConfig) -> None:
        """Initialize engine with configuration."""
        
    @abstractmethod
    async def process(self, request: EngineRequest) -> EngineResponse:
        """Process engine-specific request."""
        
    @abstractmethod
    async def get_health(self) -> HealthStatus:
        """Get engine health status."""
        
    @abstractmethod
    async def get_metrics(self) -> EngineMetrics:
        """Get engine performance metrics."""
```

### **Plugin Architecture**
Each engine supports specialized processors through a plugin system:

```python
class EnginePlugin(ABC):
    """Plugin interface for engine extensibility."""
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def can_handle(self, request: EngineRequest) -> bool:
        """Check if plugin can handle request."""
        
    @abstractmethod
    async def process(self, request: EngineRequest) -> EngineResponse:
        """Process request with plugin."""
```

### **Performance-First Design Principles**
1. **Async-First**: All operations are async with proper resource management
2. **Memory Efficient**: Streaming processing where possible, minimal memory footprint
