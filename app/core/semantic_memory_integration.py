"""
Semantic Memory Integration for Enhanced Context Engine

Bridges the existing semantic memory service with enhanced context management,
providing optimized performance, caching, and cross-agent knowledge sharing.

Features:
- High-performance semantic search with <50ms latency
- Intelligent caching and connection pooling
- Cross-agent knowledge discovery with privacy controls
- Context compression and summarization
- Real-time performance monitoring
