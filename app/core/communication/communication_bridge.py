Communication Bridge for Multi-Protocol Connectivity

This module provides communication bridging capabilities for connecting different
CLI protocols and communication channels (WebSocket, Redis, HTTP, etc.).

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INTERFACE DEFINITION
This file contains the complete interface definition and architectural design.
The implementation will be delegated to a subagent to avoid context rot.
