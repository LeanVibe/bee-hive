WorkflowEngine - Consolidated Workflow Orchestration for LeanVibe Agent Hive 2.0

Consolidates 8+ workflow implementations into a single, high-performance DAG engine:
- workflow_engine.py (1,960 LOC) - Core DAG workflow
- enhanced_workflow_engine.py (906 LOC) - Advanced features  
- advanced_orchestration_engine.py (761 LOC) - Orchestration
- workflow_engine_error_handling.py (904 LOC) - Error handling
- strategic_implementation_engine.py (1,017 LOC) - Strategic planning

Performance Targets:
- <2s workflow compilation for complex DAGs
- Parallel execution optimization
- Real-time dependency resolution  
- Checkpoint-based recovery
