## 🚀 Ready to Build? Choose Your Experience

**Convinced by the demos above? Pick your setup:**

### 🎯 DevContainer (Recommended - <2 minutes)
**Zero-configuration autonomous development:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeanVibe/bee-hive.git
code bee-hive  # Opens in VS Code
# Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
# ✅ DONE! Autonomous AI agents ready to build
```
*Prerequisites: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [DevContainers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) + [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)*

### ⚡ Professional Setup (<5 minutes)
**Enterprise-grade one-command setup:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeanVibe/bee-hive.git && cd bee-hive
make setup
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env.local
make start
```

### 🎮 Keep Trying Sandbox
**Not ready to install? [Continue in Sandbox Mode](docs/SANDBOX_MODE_GUIDE.md)**

**✅ Success Indicator**: All methods result in working autonomous development at http://localhost:8000

## 📋 Using Legacy Scripts?

**If you've used old script names** (setup.sh, setup-fast.sh, start-fast.sh, etc.), they still work but now redirect to new standardized commands:

- **Old**: `./setup.sh` → **New**: `make setup`
- **Old**: `./start-fast.sh` → **New**: `make start`
- **Old**: `./stop-fast.sh` → **New**: `make stop`

**📖 Full migration guide**: [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md)  
**🎯 Professional interface**: `make help` - Self-documenting command system
