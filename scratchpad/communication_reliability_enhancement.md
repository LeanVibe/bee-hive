# LeanVibe Agent Hive 2.0 - Communication System Reliability Enhancement

## Project Overview
Enhancing the LeanVibe Agent Hive 2.0 Communication System to achieve production-grade reliability with enterprise messaging patterns. Current evaluation: 6/10, targeting 9/10+ reliability score.

## Current Infrastructure Analysis
✅ **Existing Components Analyzed:**
- `/app/core/communication.py` - Redis Streams implementation with basic DLQ support
- `/app/core/agent_communication_service.py` - Enhanced service with consumer group support
- `/app/core/dead_letter_queue.py` - Advanced DLQ with poison message detection
- `/app/core/enhanced_communication_load_testing.py` - Comprehensive testing framework

✅ **Current Capabilities:**
- Redis Streams messaging with consumer groups
