## 2. Multi-Stream Coordination Framework

### Dependencies and Sequencing

**Stream Dependency Matrix**:
```
Stream 1A (Testing) → Stream 1B (Mobile) → Stream 1C (Infrastructure) → Stream 2A (Self-Mod)
     ↓                     ↓                        ↓                       ↓
   Base QA          →  Enhanced UI        →    Production Ready    →   Autonomous
 Foundation            Components             Infrastructure         Self-Improvement
```

**Critical Path Analysis**:

2. **System Stability**: Performance regression >10%
3. **Agent Coordination Failure**: Communication breakdowns
4. **Quality Gate Failures**: Test failures or build issues
5. **Resource Exhaustion**: CPU/Memory/Storage limits

### Rollback Strategies

**Multi-Level Rollback System**:
1. **Code Level**: Git-based reversion to last stable commit
2. **Configuration Level**: Database state restoration
3. **Agent Level**: Agent state reset and reinitialization
4. **System Level**: Full system restoration from backup

**Rollback Decision Matrix**:
```yaml
Code Issues: 
  Trigger: Test failures, compilation errors
  Action: Git revert + agent reinitialization
  
Configuration Issues:
  Trigger: Agent coordination failures  
  Action: Database state restoration
  
System Issues:
  Trigger: Performance regression, resource exhaustion
