### Real-time Data Strategy
**Approach:** API polling with WebSocket upgrades where available
**Update Frequency:**
- **System Health**: 10-second polling
- **Agent Status**: 5-second polling
- **Events**: WebSocket real-time or 2-second polling
- **Tasks**: Real-time updates via WebSocket

### Component Integration Strategy
**Leverage Existing**: Use kanban-board, agent-health-panel, event-timeline
**Enhance Existing**: Add real API integrations and professional styling
**Build Minimal New**: Only components not already available
