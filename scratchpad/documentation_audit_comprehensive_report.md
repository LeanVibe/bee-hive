# Comprehensive Documentation Audit Report
## LeanVibe Agent Hive - Script Interface Modernization

**Date**: 2025-01-08  
**Context**: Post-transformation from script chaos to enterprise-grade make-based interface  
**Quality Score**: Targeting 9.5/10 consistency across all documentation

## Executive Summary

**AUDIT SCOPE**: 78 files with script references found across the entire project  
**CRITICAL ISSUES**: 50+ files with outdated script commands need updating  
**QUALITY SCORE MISALIGNMENT**: 17 files still reference 8.0/10 instead of 9.5/10  
**PRIORITY**: HIGH - Documentation inconsistency undermines professional transformation
