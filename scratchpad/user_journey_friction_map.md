# User Journey Friction Map

## Critical Friction Points Analysis

### Friction Point 1: Entry Point Confusion (Impact: 8/10)
**Location**: First 30 seconds of discovery
**Problem**: 5+ competing entry points create immediate decision fatigue
**Current Flow**: README → WELCOME → Role Choice → Path Selection → Setup Method Choice
**Friction**: User forced to make 3+ decisions before any value demonstration

### Friction Point 2: Premature Role Commitment (Impact: 9/10)
**Location**: WELCOME.md role selection
**Problem**: Forces immediate role-based decision without context
**Current Options**: Developer | Executive/PM | Enterprise | Technical Evaluator
**Friction**: Users don't know enough about the platform to choose correctly

### Friction Point 3: Setup Method Paralysis (Impact: 7/10)
**Location**: Multiple setup guides
**Problem**: 3+ different setup approaches with unclear differentiation
**Current Options**: DevContainer | Fast Setup | Manual | Traditional
**Friction**: Unclear which method is best for user's situation

### Friction Point 4: Value Proposition Buried (Impact: 8/10)
**Location**: Throughout entry flow
**Problem**: "Autonomous development" claims not immediately proven
**Current Flow**: Claims → Setup → Maybe Demo
**Friction**: Setup commitment required before value proof

### Friction Point 5: Documentation Sprawl (Impact: 6/10)
**Location**: docs/ directory navigation
**Problem**: 100+ files with unclear hierarchy
**Current State**: Flat structure with archive mixing with active content
**Friction**: Information discovery requires exploration effort

## User Psychology Analysis

### Decision Fatigue Pattern
1. **Entry Point Choice**: Which file to read?
2. **Role Selection**: Which role describes me?
3. **Path Selection**: Which path matches my goals?
4. **Setup Method**: Which setup approach?
5. **Success Validation**: Did I choose correctly?

### Cognitive Load Assessment
- **High**: Multiple competing truth sources
- **High**: Inconsistent messaging across entry points
- **Medium**: Technical jargon without context
- **Low**: Once on single path, progression is clearer

### Modern Developer Expectations
**Expected Pattern**: GitHub README → Quick demo → Progressive setup
**Current Pattern**: README → Role decision → Path selection → Setup choice
**Gap**: Missing immediate value demonstration and clear success path

## Optimal User Journey Design

### Stage 1: Discovery (0-30 seconds)
**Goal**: Understand value proposition immediately
**Flow**: Single README → Value demo → Interest confirmation
**Success Metric**: User wants to continue after 30 seconds

### Stage 2: Proof (30 seconds - 5 minutes)
**Goal**: See autonomous development working
**Flow**: Sandbox/demo → Working system → Value confirmation
**Success Metric**: User believes the claims are real

### Stage 3: Setup (5-15 minutes)
**Goal**: Get working system locally
**Flow**: Single optimal path → Success validation → Next steps
**Success Metric**: System working with clear success indicators

### Stage 4: Customization (15+ minutes)
**Goal**: Adapt to specific needs
**Flow**: Role-based customization → Advanced features → Integration
**Success Metric**: User can customize for their specific use case

## Friction Elimination Strategy

### 1. Single Entry Point
- **Primary**: README.md serves 80% of users
- **Secondary**: WELCOME.md for role-specific needs
- **Tertiary**: Specialized docs for advanced use cases

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
- **Level 1**: Value proposition + instant demo
- **Level 2**: Quick setup for interested users
- **Level 3**: Customization and advanced features
- **Level 4**: Integration and enterprise concerns

### 3. Proof Before Commitment
- **Sandbox Mode**: Try before setup
- **DevContainer**: One-click experience
- **Demo Video**: See it working immediately
- **Success Stories**: Real user validation

### 4. Clear Success Indicators
- **Each Stage**: Obvious progress markers
- **Exit Criteria**: Clear "you're ready for next step"
- **Validation**: Automated success checking
- **Recovery**: Clear paths if something goes wrong
