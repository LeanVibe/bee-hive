# Autonomous Dashboard Development Plan
## Using LeanVibe Agent Hive to Build Self-Monitoring Interface

### Executive Summary
Leverage the confirmed working multi-agent coordination system (5 active agents, 16-second development cycles) to build a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring and managing the autonomous development platform itself. This creates a powerful feedback loop where agents build tools to monitor and improve their own capabilities.

### Confirmed System Capabilities
- ✅ **5 active agents** coordinating successfully on complex tasks
- ✅ **16-second development cycles** for complete features  
- ✅ **End-to-end workflow**: Requirements → Architecture → Implementation → Testing → Documentation
- ✅ **Real-time monitoring** and agent status tracking
- ✅ **Multi-agent coordination** with specialized roles
