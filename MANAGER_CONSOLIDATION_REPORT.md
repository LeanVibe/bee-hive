status = await orchestrator.get_agent_status(agent_id)
success = await orchestrator.shutdown_agent(agent_id, graceful=True)
```

**Task Coordination (SimpleOrchestrator Compatible):**
```python
# Original API preserved exactly
task_id = await orchestrator.delegate_task(
    task_description="Implement user authentication",
    task_type="backend_development", 
    priority=TaskPriority.HIGH,
    required_capabilities=["python", "security"]
